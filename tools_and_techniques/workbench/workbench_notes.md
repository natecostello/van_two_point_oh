## Cut potential notes:

73.5" - longest 80/20 cut
6' 1.5" - longest 80/20 cut

Assume left of blade is 12"
right of blade is 1.5"
=> assume anything less than 13" must be cut on right side of blade, which means you need 11.5" on the right (if you hang over the extra. 12.5")
=> you need 5' 2" on left (if you hang over the extra 8")
5' 2" + 1' 1.5" + 11.5" = 6' + (2 + 1.5 + 11.5)" = 6' + 15" = 7' 3" 
8' - 10" = 7' 2"
