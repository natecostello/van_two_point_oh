TODO: Need to carefully consider wall mounting due to the Boron steel over the passenger door per the BEMM.  Will need to use existing holes in this area or skip l-track/overhead storage in this region.

According to the forum (search "boron") you can drill boron steel if you do so properly with cobalt drill bits.  Also, according to the forum, you can place a plus nut in a square hole, and you can insert, partial crush, and insert if depth is shallow: [forum discussion](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/several-plusnut-questions-different-size-holes.67194/)

Looks like the side L-track should run in the row of holes about 8" down from the rib that will match a 12x12 Duffle Bag.
