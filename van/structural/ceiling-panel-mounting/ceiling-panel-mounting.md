![ceiling forward rib dimensions](front-ribs-dims.png)

The ceiling is composed of three panels.  The Forward panel spans from the rib behind the headliner (rib 1) back to the next rib (rib 2) covering the curved transition of the roof.  The Mid panel spans from rib 2, over rib 3, to rib 4.  The Aft panel spans from rib 4 to the arch over the D-pillar.

## Forward Panel

TODO: Describe Mount Scheme

## Mid Panel

The forward edge of the mid panel is retained under an awthart strip of L-track installed on rib 2.  The aft edge of the mid panel is retained under an athwart strip of L-track installed on rib 4.  The middle-center of the Mid panel is help by an athwart strip of L-track that bolts through the panel into rib 3.  The side edges of the mid panel are restrained by three LED Channel mounting clips on each side that fasten through the panel into overhanging ceiling brackets VHB taped to the top of fore-aft ceiling L-track.

## Ceiling Brackets
The ceiling brackets contain two holes on each side that each accept a 6-32 clip nut.
