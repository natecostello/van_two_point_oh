Orton privides a great [hint](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/what-to-make-countertop-from.76956/post-1015234): "If your countertop is located at the slider door add to the width of the countertop where it is in front of the door. The part of the countertop in front of the door extends 3 1/2" toward the door. Makes a big difference to have the counter top wider."

TODO: Research whether drawer hardware has lengths that are compatible with our cabinet depths.  Kenetube used [blum](xhttps://www.blum.com/us/en/products/runnersystems/overview/).  Specifically it looks like he used the "tandembox" line.  Catalog is [here](http://downloads.cabinetparts.com/auto/Tandembox-Complete-Catalog-92-pages.pdf).  It appears the have slides in 16, 18, 20, and 22+ inch lengths.

It appears that blum hardware is available to support 5/8 thick cabinet/drawer faces.  We need to use 5/8 because that is the max thickness for standard marine slam latches.
