# Requirements

* Waterproof
* Room for future expansion
* Maintainable/Servicable

# Underside Pass-throughs

My favored concept uses a 3 inch threaded PVC nipple.  It will pass through a ~3 inch hole drilled/cut though a flat area in the steel floor as well as the insulation and top floor as well as a waterproof junction box with a ~3 inch hole in its base.  3 inch female threaded PVC flanges will capture the nipple between the inside floor outside as well as capture the waterproof junction box.  Sealing material will be used at the perimeter of the junction box and the junction box hole between the box and the exterior floor.  Holes will be drilled into 4 sides of the junction box with cable glands providing the waterproof barrier into the junction box.

# Roof Pass-throughs

The roof pass through will use a similar technique, though multiple smaller holes and PVC may be used to accomodate large dimensioned terminal boxes to maximize room for expansion.  VBH would aid in securing.
