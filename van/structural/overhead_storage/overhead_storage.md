Based on available L-track placements, we need to look at 14x14 inch bags.

TODO: Measure wall and ceiling L-track

Candidates:

[30x15x14](https://www.duffelbags.com/duffel-bags/travel-gear-bag-xlarge): Not clear which dimension is H or W.  ~$35 SKU:EV-1015XL - Via Phone: 14Hx15W

[30x15Wx14H](https://www.duffelbags.com/duffel-bags/large-polyester-duffel-3sizes): ~$75 SKU:NP-5275-77

[30x14x14](https://www.duffelbags.com/duffel-bags/classic-gear-bag-large): $34 SKU:EV-1005LD

[30x15Wx14H](https://www.duffelbags.com/duffel-bags/duffelgear-grand-canyon-duffel-30inch): $24 SKU:DFL30-36

Based on a crude fit test, we've narrowed the sizes to 14x14 and 14Hx15W Bags.  Once we do an actual fit test with L-track in place this could change, but for now, those will be our first trials.
