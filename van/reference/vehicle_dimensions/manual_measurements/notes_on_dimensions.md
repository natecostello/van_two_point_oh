# Notes on dimensions

## Wheelwell Length

Midway drawing has  34"

wheel-well-size.jpg has  33.25"

**Our measurment has 33.5"**

## Wheelwell Width

wheel-well-size.jpg has 7"

Our photo suggests 7.5"

**Ford drawing between wells + our measured width has 7.2"**

## Wheelwell Hight

wheel-well-size.jpg has 10" (but looks to be from installed floor)

**Our photos suggest 10.75"**

## Forward bulkhead to Wheelwell forward face

Midway drawing has 80.0625"

**Our measurement has 79.5"**

## Wheelwell rear face to rear pillar forward face

Midway drawing has 43.9375"

**Our measurements have 42.75" (calculated from overall length of 155.75")**

## Forward bulkhead to rear pillar forward face

Midway drawing has 158"

**Our measurements have 155.75"**

## Ceiling Rib Measurements

Our measurments are rear of van to the rear face of the ribs.

Thickness of thickets part of ribs is estimated at 3 inches (in model).

Ribs taper a half inch or so from top to downward face.

Ribs are not uniform depth or thickness from athwart edge to center.

Rib depth at center (vertical thickness) is 1.75"

Ribs taper deeper (vertical thickness) near athwart edge.  I don't have this dimension.  I am estimating 3".  This assumption dictates ceiling hight (off rib) at edge of van.

## Ceiling Height Measurements

Our measurement is 79.5" from top of floor rib to bottom of ceiling rib at van center.

Our measurement is 81.25" from top of floor rib to bottom of ceiling at van center.

Our measurement is 76.5" from floor to side of to bottom of ceiling rib at van side.

Assuming floor rib height is 3/8" based on our measurement and [this post](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/subfloor-rib-height-dilemma.44361/#post-559433).

Geometry of drop in ceiling after the forward most rib to cab is estimated (no measurements were taken).

## Frame

Model is based on measurement between internal faces, and measurement between outer faces and exterior wall overhang.  Frame width is thus derived and likely not accurate.  Frame vertical depth is assumed to be 7.5 oo inches as it was  not measured.

## TODO

Extrude frames (and add assumptions)

Drop ceiling in front (add assumption)

Add floor rib offset
