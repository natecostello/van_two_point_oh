Based on testing performed by a member of the [diymobileaudio forum](https://www.diymobileaudio.com/) and owner of a related [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/651457188787366/), Dynamat extreme and Resonix appear to be the best.  Searching around I found some reports of noico having a smell.  Hein sells a 3M product that is considered best by weight, but it is spendy.  

Right now we are leaning towards dynamat based on cost and easy availability.
