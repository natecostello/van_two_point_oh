Based on testing performed by a member of the [diymobileaudio forum](https://www.diymobileaudio.com/) and owner of a related [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/651457188787366/), Dynamat extreme is the [most effective by weight](https://www.diymobileaudio.com/threads/sound-deadening-cld-testing.146403/post-3522858).  Searching around I found some reports of noico having a smell.  Hein sells a 3M product that is considered best by weight, but it is spendy.  

We selected Dynamat extreme based on the above assessment, cost, and easy availability.
