The right tool for the right job!  This [thread](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/must-have-tools-for-camper-conversion.79127/#post-1038918) is a good startingn point.

**Transfer Punch Set** - These are used to "transfer" a pattern of holes from one piece to another.  Note, when transfering holes from thin materials, the raised part that dimples the material can prevent the circumference of the transfer punch from locating itself relative to a hole.

Examples: [Harbor Freight Transfer Punch set](https://www.harborfreight.com/28-piece-transfer-punch-set-3577.html)

**Centering Transfer Center Punch** - This is useful if there isn't enough "meat" or thickness around a hole to locate a traditional transfer punch.  An example is trying to center a hole through L-track where the bottom of the chamfer is too thin to properly locate a transfer punch.

Examples: [Penn Tool Hole Transfer Center Punch](https://www.penntoolco.com/precise-econo-pic-hole-transfer-center-punch-3-16-1-1-16-tt-551/)

**Transfer Screw Set** - These are useful to locate holes on the backside of a piece.  Say I have 4 1/4-20 threaded holes in a wall and you need to mount a panel to that wall.  You insert the transfer screws int to the threaded holes, place the panel against the wall, and dimple the backside by pressing the panel against the transfer screws.  Remove and drill the proper locations.

Examples: [Transfer Screw Set on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/HHIP-3601-0250-Piece-Transfer-Screw/dp/B00N411MCC/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=transfer+screw&qid=1605278170&sr=8-4)

**Center Scribe** - Useful to scribe a center line down a long strip of metal (e.g. 1/2 series 80/20 or L-track) to aid in drilling/transfering holes.

Example: [Center Scribe](https://www.amazon.com/Center-Finder-Tweippy-Woodworking-Marking/dp/B0823ZPC1X)

**Stop Block System** - Useful for cutting precise lengths of 80/20.

Example: [Kreg system](https://www.kregtool.com/shop/cutting/miter-saw-cutting/precision-trak-stop-kit/KMS8000.html?fbclid=IwAR0sE1Tpf1dBXN9FFO-cDCK8d-jp5T2DfMBtDocI2LxzzkcbDgPuF6IJ2Bo) ($140)

**Hot Wire Foam Cutter** - Will be used to cut the foam used to fill the channels in the van before the top upper layer of XPS.

Example: [Hercules Hot Wire Foam Cutter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HY8PFD8/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A2IGZ09LPUKLVH&psc=1) ($140)

**Cheap But Accurate DMM (Logging a plus)** - Will be used for battery construction and cell balancing.

Example:[ut61e+](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/new-uni-t-ut61-series-(ut61e)/)

Look into sigrok for logging without installing stupid software.  Also considering picking up one of [these](https://www.ebay.ca/itm/AD584-High-Precision-Voltage-Reference-Module-4-Channel-2-5V-7-5V-5V-10V/311498494419?_trkparms=aid%3D1110009%26algo%3DSPLICE.COMPLISTINGS%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20200423103423%26meid%3D5e0d3126ee144abbb35236831af89d67%26pid%3D100011%26rk%3D3%26rkt%3D12%26mehot%3Dpp%26sd%3D300937695293%26itm%3D311498494419%26pmt%3D1%26noa%3D0%26pg%3D2047675%26algv%3Ddefault%26brand%3DUnbranded&_trksid=p2047675.c100011.m1850) to check it.

**Oscilliscope with CAN Decode** - Would be useful.  And I've always wanted one.

Example: [Siglent 4 Channel with CAN etc](https://www.amazon.com/Siglent-SDS1104X-oscilloscope-channels-standard/dp/B0771N1ZF9?ref_=ast_slp_dp) ($499)

**Top Balancing System** - Will be used to top balance cells for battery construction.

Example: [ESP32 based system](https://diysolarforum.com/threads/top-balancing-setup-w-arduino-monitoring.15773/).  This system uses a [HRPG-300-3.3](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/260/HRPG-300-SPEC-1511701.pdf) which is capable of 60A at 3.8V.  This would charge 16 280AH cells in approximately 37 hours from 50% SOC.  It would require use of [shotty diodes](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/stmicro/STPS20SM60D/2827130) in parallel detailed in that the above thread.

**High Capacity DC PSU** - Could be used to top balance cells and to test the 12V and 24V electrical system ahead of battery light off.  Can also be used as a virtual solar array to provide input to MPPT.

Example:[Riden RD6018](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JPKQD41/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_2KKXKZ460C1FY0MTXQV3) ($199)

**Capacity Tester** - This will be used to test individual cell capacity to allow matching/verifying cells.  The example below all so has serial out, so logging of tests via raspberry pi should be pretty easy.

Example: [Atorch 4-wire](https://www.amazon.com/Electronic-upgraded-electronic-adjustment-discharge/dp/B08MQG1FQ8) ($100)

**Plus-Nut Setting Tool** - This Tool is used to set plus nuts consistantly

Example: [Astro Pnuematic Tool 1450](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JBNNJ3Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s04?ie=UTF8&psc=1) is recommended in this [forum thread](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/must-have-tools-for-camper-conversion.79127/post-1038821).
