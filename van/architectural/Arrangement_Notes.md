# Arrangement Notes

**Bed Length - ** In VAN 1.0 there is a substantial amount of extra bed length.  At least 6 inches, up to 12 inches could be removed from the bed length assuming the transit model bed is of similar length.  TODO: Measure bed length in Van 1.0.

**Bed Thickness -** In VAN 1.0 the bed is 8" thick.  Consider using a 5" or 6" firm memory foam mattress.  That would yield an additional 3 inches vertical space under bed with no effect on above bed volume.
