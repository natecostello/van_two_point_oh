Low vs High 80/20 Roof Rack Brackets and Pads:

Goal/Desire:

Roof Rack running from front attachment point all the way to rear of HR LWB Extened

Height of fore-aft rails is lowest possible to allow crossmember/panel on top to clear the curve of roof

- does low "towers" allow this?

Support at rear to avoid/minimize cantelever?

Can you use double wide 15 series (oriented vertically) with the tall towers (yes)

Convo:

Low roof brackets do require 1/2 or so spacer to clear the center of the roof.

High roof brackets do have a 6th pad for the rear most end of roof.

Low roof brackets might not be compatible with the 6th pad.

You can use double wide with tall brackets. 

Working on new bracket design that attaches under 80/20 that will be wider, but not as wide as 58.3 inch panel.  However, they would be compatible with angle aluminum that could support that width.  These will also have a 6th pad configuration.  Should be available by the time we get our van.
