# Internal Arrangement Notes

By moving. the Battery to an undermount cavity central to the rear, it might make sense to move the water forward under the sink.  This will balance port-starboard load with the fridge/freezer better, and provide easier fill access through the back of the sink cabinet or with a dedicated fill hole in the back of the cabinet.

To do this it looks like 3 could fit depth-wise in the cabinet, but it may require slightly deepening the cabinet..like .25 inches.

For cabinet depths don't forget the thickness of the cabinet drawer and door faces.  Its getting tight

## Opposing side fridge/freezer

By orienting the fridge/freezer across from each other toward the bed, they can be tucked closer to the wall as they will not interfere with the structural support midway along the cargo area.

### Rear Storage Benefit

As a result the stove moves to the driver side forward of the fridge.  This moves the propane tank/locker to the driver side as well.  The width of the drivers side under-bed support increases to accomodate the propane.  With the water forward under the sink, this allows the passenger side under-bed support to width to reduce to the minimum amount to clear the wheel well.  Overall the usable volume under the bed increases.  Another side benefit is more room on the rear face of the drive side under-bed support for the electirical panels.

### Next Steps

Consider moving the Multiplus and Propane locker above the wheelwell and protrude past edge of passenger side under-bed support.  Also locate breaker panels in this region.  This would allow the passenger side under-bed support to move back approximately 4 inches.  This would further increase under-bed volume.  In fact, it doesn't appear that locating the multiplus is absolutely neccessary (it can fit in the narrow portion also). 

Consider raising bed and using thinner mattress.
