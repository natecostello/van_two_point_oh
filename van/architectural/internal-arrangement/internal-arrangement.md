Our internal arrangement went through 12 major concepts and more minor iterations than we can count.  These changes were painless to implement because of the tool we employed.

Our primary tool for arrangement was SketchUp Make 17 (the free version), a carry over from Van 1.0.  We highly recommend a digital model based approach but it is critical to be disciplined about accuracy.  Once you have an accurate model, that becomes your reference for future panel cuts, structure, etc.  It's a fantastic way to work.

Early in 2020, we scoured the internet for transit cargo dimensions for our initial concepts.  In September of 2020 we went to a dealer and spent an afternoon with a tape measure, note pad, and camera phone to record all the relevant dimensions of the interior and underbody.  There is a link to all of these resources at the end of this article.

We translated these dimension into a blank SketchUp Transit model and then verified that our concept fit.  There are links to the blank transit model and the full model with our interior design at the end of this article.

We had a pretty good idea from Van 1.0 what we wanted.  This dictated the general layout.  As we settled on specific equipment (e.g. the brand and model of the refrigerator), those constraints were factored in.  Specifically we'd create models for each appliance and introduce those into the existing concept and modify as necessary.  Upon physical receipt of the components we'd carefully measure, and update the component model overall arrangement model as needed.

The constraints/characteristics/requirements that yielded our final arrangement are as follows:

* A platform bed, full size width or larger, in a north-south rear-of-van arrangement, low enough to allow us to sit upright comfortably.

* A port and starboard galley with a center isle.  The center isle will be 24 inches wide minimum (and wide enough to remove the largest installed component).  Each side will be the constrained to the width of its components.  This allows two adults to slip past each other.

* A booth seat on the driver side that sits opposite the driver seat in its swiveled position.  Occasionally we host a fellow camper for meals or drinks in rough weather so we wanted to comfortable seat three for food and drink.  The booth seat will house the Espar heater and additional general storage.

* A sink with a sprayer faucet located on the passenger side in the area where the counter overlaps the sliding door opening.  We ultimately selected an Ikea X sink and Blah faucet which we factored into the arrangement.

* A simple "cold" only water system that will be housed under the sink, and will be accessible from the outside with the sliding door open for filling.  We ultimately selected three 5-gallon jerry cans as the "tank".

* The galley will include a propane oven/range.  We ultimately selected a Greystone X inch oven/range.  We chose the passenger side for the oven, as close to the slider as possible for ventilation while cooking.

* The galley will include a fridge and freezer.  We ultimately selected a Vitrifrigo XL fridge and YL freezer.  We arranged these on the driver side to balance the weight and since the sink and oven location ruled out the passenger side.

* Overhead storage would be slightly modified duffle-bags attached to wall and ceiling L-track, similar to what we did with Van 1.0.

* The electrical system will include a 16x280AH cell lithium battery that will be positioned as close to the long centerline and to the rear axle as practical.

* Electrical controls like breakers, inverter mode, and meters would be accessible from the interior but not prominent.  This was a departure from Van 1.0 that required opening the rear doors to access the electrical system.

* To the maximum extent practical, heavy fixed components/appliances would be arranged such that the port and starboard weights are equal.

* All structure would be fabricated from 15 series 8020.  





 
Maximizing ease of assembly and free standing integrity of the 8020 led to some subtle additional constraints:

First, a continuous length of 8020 at the interior base of the port and starboard galley was desirable since the exterior base would be broken up to vehicle interferences.  Second, a continuous length of 8020 at the exterior top structure that runs from the bed area to the end of the galley sides was desirable since the interior top would be broken up do to arrangement limitations.

These two constraints dictated both the counter and bed structure height.  Specifically, the stackup of the base 8020, the fridge, and the fridge compressor set the height of the galley structure.  Since the top of the galley structure shares its top exterior piece of 8020 with the bed/garage, the bed/garage structure height is set also.
