The van will use an inverter/charger to convert DC to AC power to supply AC loads.  It will also allow battery charging while on shore power.

## Selection

Based on our experience, we will be using a Victron inverter/charger.  The two choices, given our 24V DC system, are the Multiplus 3000VA  and the Multiplus Compact 2000VA inverter/chargers.
