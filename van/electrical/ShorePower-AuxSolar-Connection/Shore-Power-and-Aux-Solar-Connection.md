Our shore power and auxilliary solar panel connection will copy the Lorax by connecting under the rear pillar.  He provides some details in [this post](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/the-lorax-build-thread.72698/post-1074290). 



The solar panel connection is from AM Solar, [here](https://amsolar.com/rv-connections/plug-prtbl-batt-8ga).
