We settled on a 21 inch Greystone 3 Burner Oven/Range.  There is some experience with it on the transit forum and the Dometic's availability was sketch.

From the [drawing](greystone-drawing.pdf) and [manual](greystone-instruction-manual.pdf):

BTU Per Hour:
 * Front burner 8000 BTU/hr 
 * Left burner 6500 BTU/hr
 * Right burner 6500 BTU/hr
 * Oven 7100 BTU/hr
 * Total 28100 BTU/hr

Inlet Pressure: 
 * 10" WC min
 * 13.8" WC max

Power usage: less than 2A at 12V.
