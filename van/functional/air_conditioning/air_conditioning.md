## Options

One option used by a forum member documented [here](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/lwb-extended-tall-day-van-tailgater.37297/post-643802), is [proair](https://www.proairllc.com/).

The go to option is the [HD-24s 7 k BTU/h](https://www.cruisencomfortusa.com/hd-series) from cruisecomfort.  This is available in 24V and seems powerful enough (especially with the bed-curtain concept).

Residential Minisplits are a cheap catalog option.  Sprinter Source users have some experience noted [here](https://sprinter-source.com/forums/index.php?threads/41899/).  For the transit, it looks like the only viable mounting option would be on the back door using something like the aluminess box carrier products.  Flexible lines would be a must.



## Installation Options

My leading install locations would be for the interior unit to "hide" in an over head bag at the rear most location in the sleeping area.  The exterior unit would be installed under the van, forward of the battery box, behind the rear differential.

Locating the interior unit in the sleeping area will allow closing curtains at the foot of the bed to for a fairly small space to minimizing the cooling duty cycle and electrical use overnight while sleeping.
