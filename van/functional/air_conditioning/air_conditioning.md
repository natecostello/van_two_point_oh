## Options

One option used by a forum member documented [here](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/lwb-extended-tall-day-van-tailgater.37297/post-643802), is [proair](https://www.proairllc.com/).

The go to option is the [HD-24s 7 k BTU/h](https://www.cruisencomfortusa.com/hd-series) from cruisecomfort.  This is available in 24V and seems powerful enough (especially with the bed-curtain concept).

Residential Minisplits are a cheap catalog option.  Sprinter Source users have some experience noted [here](https://sprinter-source.com/forums/index.php?threads/41899/).  For the transit, it looks like the only viable mounting option would be on the back door using something like the aluminess box carrier products.  Flexible lines would be a must.


[This option](https://www.fleetwelcome.com/2020/05/28/hello-world/) appears attractive.  They offer a 24V version on amazon for 1800.  I would prefer something closer to 9000 btu, but for weight and size it looks hard to beat.

[This option](https://sporlanonline.com/literature/misc/parker/Catalog%20J%20ZoomLine.pdf) for flexible hoses looks promising for the residential minisplit options.

### Notes from call with velo solar (fleetwelcome.com)

Can you mount:  No problem mounting facing down.  Air intake is from sides, blows out face.  Air intake on indoor unit: 1.5 inch gap on top that draws in, blows out bottom.  Variable speed compressor.  Measures indoor temp, controlls fan and flow rate to reach target temperature, then outdoor turns off.  Instead of on and off, gradual power use.  20 SEER.  6000 BTU.  Not looking to produce higher capacity.  24V is new market.  Motor is 24V, power board is 24V, inboard unit 24V.  Noise: 33db low, wisper.  Outdoor unit is 60db.

## Installation Options

My leading install locations would be for the interior unit to "hide" in an over head bag at the rear most location in the sleeping area.  The exterior unit would be installed under the van, forward of the battery box, behind the rear differential.

Locating the interior unit in the sleeping area will allow closing curtains at the foot of the bed to for a fairly small space to minimizing the cooling duty cycle and electrical use overnight while sleeping.
