## Lighting Options

### Strip Lights

Govee is highly recommended (e.g. Bob Villa).  

Not IC lights are not cuttable.

All Govee options with voltage are listed [here](https://www.govee.com/faqs/specs).

For cuttable, 24V lights the best package appears to be H6195 from the table linked above.  It is long enough to support four runs fore-aft.  This model is available on Amazon:

Based on looking at the reviews and customer images, it appears that directly sourcing 24V power to the strip controller is totally possible.  It also looks like splicing in lines from the controller to the start of the lights is also do-able.

These appear to be the winner.


### Reading Lights

These look perfect:  red and white modes, dimmable, and support 24V:

This site has lots of options:

This is an OEM that has lots of options (but maybe not exactly what we want):

The littlite CC-EB18-LED-AW model hits all the wickets: 12-24V power, end-mount 18" gooseneck, bottom mount cord, dimming, red and white.  [BH](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1111252-REG/littlite_cc_eb18_led_aw_18_end_mount.html) has them for $135.  Yikes.
