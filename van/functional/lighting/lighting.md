## Lighting Options

### Strip Lights

Govee is highly recommended (e.g. Bob Villa).  

Not IC lights are not cuttable.

All Govee options with voltage are listed [here](https://www.govee.com/faqs/specs).

For cuttable, 24V lights the best package appears to be H6195 from the table linked above.  It is long enough to support four runs fore-aft.  This model is available on Amazon:

Based on looking at the reviews and customer images, it appears that directly sourcing 24V power to the strip controller is totally possible.  It also looks like splicing in lines from the controller to the start of the lights is also do-able.

These appear to be the winner.  Except they aren't that bright and the led density isn't great, so...

**On second thought:**

We're concerned about brightness and "spottedness" of the Govee solution.  If we give up on color, there are brighter, better CRI, seamless, 24V options.  We settled on [these lights](https://www.ledsupply.com/led-strips/tunable-white-cob-led-strip-lights), [this driver](xhttps://www.superbrightleds.com/moreinfo/rgb-led-controllers/wireless-4-channel-rgb-led-dimmer-receiver/3372/7141/), [this controller](https://www.superbrightleds.com/moreinfo/color-temp-controller/wireless-variable-color-temperature-led-dimmer-switch-for-ez-dimmer-receiver/3330/7135/), and [this button](https://www.superbrightleds.com/moreinfo/single-color-dimmer-switches/mini-rf-single-color-led-dimmer-switch-for-ez-dimmer-receiver-w-magnetic-base/3327/7133/) for by the sliding door.

We will place the dimmer near the bed, and the button near the sliding door.  These are wireless so they will not affect wire runs and voltage drop.

It looks like [this line of tracks](https://www.amazon.com/hunhun-L-Shape-Connector-Aluminum-Channel/dp/B0788CFWTV/ref=pd_bxgy_1/131-1523673-7632063?pd_rd_w=ezEhu&pf_rd_p=c64372fa-c41c-422e-990d-9e034f73989b&pf_rd_r=4015M4HCST5D13H5KF61&pd_rd_r=a3d13917-e57b-40e8-a1a0-a069687cc98d&pd_rd_wg=fMBmY&pd_rd_i=B0788CFWTV&th=1) is compatible for the ceiling and has good mount/extension supports that could accommodate a low profile 100 degree 1/4-20 phillips.  Will need to test.  There are a ton of these that look equivalent.  We opted for starlandleds brand track and muzata hardware.  We'll see.

We were a little concerned with brightness and coverage.  A comparison of two ceiling runs of the tunable white to our previous van suggests 4 times the lumens and a wider beam pattern (not sure how will be affected by the channel).  Based on this we are going to start with two ceiling runs and see how that goes.

### Reading Lights

These look perfect:  red and white modes, dimmable, and support 24V:

This site has lots of options:

This is an OEM that has lots of options (but maybe not exactly what we want):

https://www.littlite.com/products

The littlite CC-EB18-LED-AW model hits all the wickets: 12-24V power, end-mount 18" gooseneck, bottom mount cord, dimming, red and white.  [BH](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1111252-REG/littlite_cc_eb18_led_aw_18_end_mount.html) has them for $135.  Yikes.
