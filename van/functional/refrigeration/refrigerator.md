**TLDR: ** For lots of reasons (arrangement flexibility, efficiency, maintainability, etc) we are going with Vitrifrigo.

​	**Fridge**
​		Vitrifrigo 4.7cuft 62.6lb 24V
​		Model: C130RBD4-F AS FRIDGE ONLY VERSION
​	**Freezer**
​		Vitrifrigo 1.8cuft 60 lbs
​		Model: C55RBN4-F 



## Fridge/Freezer Options

Vitrifrigo has a separate compressor/condenser that might be good for arranging and optimizing airflow.  Thats what was used by [Lorax](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/the-lorax-build-thread.72698/post-997532).  Local dealer is Annapolis Cruisair 410-224-0970

Note: the C75 External is equivalent external to the C60 Internal cooling model.

I took some measurements of our Isotherm Cruise 130 to establish our current usable volume.  If you just discount space for the cooling unit, we have 119L.  If you also discount for the freezer, which has never really been used, you get 95L.  Usable volume of the Vitrifrigo 75 and 55 is 130L total,  75L of fridge volume and 55L of freezer volume.  A standard RedBaron frozen pizza fits on its edge vertically, and standard ice cube trays also fit.

A forum user found some online materials that suggest the external cooling unit can be placed up to [4 ft away from the fridge/freezer](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/the-lorax-build-thread.72698/post-1073410).

@DaveInSeattle provided a [lot more information](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/the-lorax-build-thread.72698/post-1073460) after I asked:

> Here's the deal: The external compressor is connected with 2 lines of soft copper tubing, about 4' long. You can position the unit anywhere you like subject to these restrictions:
>
> 1. You need at least 36" square inches of ventilation on the front side of the unit - cooler air flowing into the unit.
> 2. You need at least 36" square inches of ventilation on the back side of the unit where the slightly warmer air can be moved away with minimal resistance.
> 3. Copper tubing will break if you mess with it too much. Design your build so that the frig and compressor can be installed and removed with minimal flexing of the tubing.
> 4. I see a build up of dust and whatever on the cooling fins of the radiator. Best if you can place it where a soft brush vacuum can hit it once or twice a year to keep the cooling as efficient as possible.

The point about accessibility for cleaning is another benefit I hadn't considered, but is substantial.

We've decided to maximize fridge and freezer space which is reflected in our preferred candidate arrangement.  Specifically:
