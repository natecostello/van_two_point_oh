The van will use propane for cooking.  While the electrical would be sufficent for induction cooking, our experience has been that gas is more convienient.

## Tank

The area occupied by the spare tire appears amenable to storage of a propane tank without any loss of ground clearence.  It also has frame features for easy bracketry work with no drilling.  There might be other locations as well.  The tank I am considering is [this 50 lb/5.9 gal tank](https://www.gowesty.com/product/-/23916/larger-capacity-lp-tank-w-level-indicator-?v=#tabs-add261).

FarOutRide states thier 20 lb (4.6 gal) propane tank used for cooking and showers every other day lasts them two months.  The above tank would yield over 10 weeks at the same burn rate.  I would expect more given no showers.  We can also use an adapter to patch in a 20 lb tank if filling up was a problem (say in Mexico).

This [thread](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/where-to-get-an-external-propane-tank-installed.77664/) has some good information on locations to install tank.

## Remote Fill

A [remote fill kit](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/nashfuel-remote-propane-fill-kit.71888/#post-955602) will probably make fill attendents a little less grumpy.
