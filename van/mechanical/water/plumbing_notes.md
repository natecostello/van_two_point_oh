## Faucet

Candidates:

KRAUS [Selletteâ„¢](https://www.kraususa.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=Sellette) Single-Handle Pull-Down Sprayer Kitchen Faucet

[Sink Drain connection](https://www.amazon.com/Ambassador-Marine-Brushed-Finish-Strainer/dp/B00GD8RY7K/ref=pd_rhf_ee_s_bmx_0_7/132-6172178-6878621?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00GD8RY7K&pd_rd_r=c5ead015-bd52-4676-851c-ed77fa559e6c&pd_rd_w=lIYF5&pd_rd_wg=9EE78&pf_rd_p=ab01b43d-20a4-41f2-b80b-e4dd747d1a01&pf_rd_r=KWM085Z2HEQC6C1JMNZG&psc=1&refRID=KWM085Z2HEQC6C1JMNZG)

## Storage

The baseline plan is 15 gallons of storage with jerry cans.  In the future, a large tank could be fabricated to allow more water storage.

## Graywater

The sink will drain outside the van to a temporary collection botter where needed (e.g. and empty milk jug).

## Pump

We considered the following 24V water pumps:

* [Shurflo 4008-131-E65](pds-4008-131-x65.pdf) which can supply 3.2 GPM and is available for ~$140 + shipping
* [Shurflo Aqua King II](pds-4138-131-x65.pdf) which can supply 3.1 GPM and is available for ~ $150
* [Shurflo Aqua King II Premium 4.0](pds-4148-163-x75.pdf) which can supply 4.0 GPM and is available for ~ $217 + shipping
* [Shurflo Aqua King II Supreme 5.0](pds-4158-163-x75.pdf) which can supply 5.0 GPM and is available for $279.98 with shipping
* [Remco 55Aquajet-AES-24](55aquajet-aes-24-spec.pdf) which can supply 3.4 GPM but cannot be found online.
* [Remco 55Aquajet-ARV-24](55aquajet-arv-24-spec.pdf) which can supply 5.3 GPM and is available for ~ $340.

We opted for the Shurflo Aqua King II Supreme.  It should have plenty of umph for sourcing a sprayer/shower.  It was backordered at most places, we ordered from AnchorExpress.com, who had the best price, but some questionable reviews and unclear stock.  We'll rant if it goes south.

## Reverse Osmosis

Eventually, given the amount of time we spend ocean side, it would be advantageous to have an RO desalinator.  DIY is doable.  The cost is the high pressure pump and drive motor, but integration looks doable.
