## Faucet

We ended up with the [Kraus Bolden 18 inch faucet](https://www.kraususa.com/kitchen/kitchen-faucets/commercial-style-faucets/kraus-kpf-1610sfsmb.html).  We opted for this over the Sellette to ensure clearance to the overhead storage.

~~KRAUS [Selletteâ„¢](https://www.kraususa.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=Sellette) Single-Handle Pull-Down Sprayer Kitchen Faucet.~~


## Storage

We opted for 3 Scepter brand jerry cans.  These are Nato dimensions and pretty standard.

## Graywater

The sink will drain outside the van to a temporary collection bottle where needed (e.g. and empty milk jug).  A fitting like [this](https://www.dripdepot.com/item/layflat-oval-hose-insert-by-fpt-adapter-barb-size-1-half-inch-fpt-size-1-half-inch) should allow connection of the sink drain to plastic tubing.  Apparently sink drains are pretty standard with 1.5 inch female NPT thread.

## Sink

We selected the smaller varient of the Ikea Norrsjon sink.

## Pump

We considered the following 24V water pumps:

* [Shurflo 4008-131-E65](pds-4008-131-x65.pdf) which can supply 3.2 GPM and is available for ~$140 + shipping
* [Shurflo Aqua King II](pds-4138-131-x65.pdf) which can supply 3.1 GPM and is available for ~ $150
* [Shurflo Aqua King II Premium 4.0](pds-4148-163-x75.pdf) which can supply 4.0 GPM and is available for ~ $217 + shipping
* [Shurflo Aqua King II Supreme 5.0](pds-4158-163-x75.pdf) which can supply 5.0 GPM and is available for $279.98 with shipping
* [Remco 55Aquajet-AES-24](55aquajet-aes-24-spec.pdf) which can supply 3.4 GPM but cannot be found online.
* [Remco 55Aquajet-ARV-24](55aquajet-arv-24-spec.pdf) which can supply 5.3 GPM and is available for ~ $340.

We opted for the Shurflo Aqua King II Supreme.  It should have plenty of umph for sourcing a sprayer/shower.  It was backordered at most places, we ordered from AnchorExpress.com, who had the best price, but some questionable reviews and unclear stock.  We'll rant if it goes south.

## Reverse Osmosis

Eventually, given the amount of time we spend ocean side, it would be advantageous to have an RO desalinator.  DIY is doable.  The cost is the high pressure pump and drive motor, but integration looks doable.
