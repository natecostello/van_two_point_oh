Aluminess makes a driver side tire carrier/ladder combination that works for us.  They also make a passenger side box carrier that should work for mounting a mini-splits.

The tire carrier/ladder combination is compatible with our hinge type (180 degree).  We need to confirm that the passenger side is also compatible with the 180 degree hinge (email sent).

Per 2020-07-07 Phone Call:

Both rear door carriers are compatible with both hinges types.

Lead time for the driver side ladder/tire carrier combo: Mid-October +/- 2 weeks
Lead time for the passenger side box carrier: Mid-September, but could be Mid-October +/- 2 weeks
Order placed with deposit of ~1/2 total
