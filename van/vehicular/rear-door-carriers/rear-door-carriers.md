Aluminess makes a driver side tire carrier/ladder combination that works for us.  They also make a passenger side box carrier that should work for mounting a mini-splits.

The tire carrier/ladder combination is compatible with our hinge type (180 degree).  We need to confirm that the passenger side is also compatible with the 180 degree hinge (email sent).
