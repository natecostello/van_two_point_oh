**Questions:**

Scuff plate kit vs heavy duty scuff plate kit?  Can also upgrade to heavy duty scuff plate.

Aftermarket security vs Perimeter alarm? Will do aftermarket.

What is the Vehicle maintenance Monitor?  Displays oil left and TPMS on the main display.

Can you have both 60C and 60D (Cruise Control and Adaptive Cruise) (Do you need both). No Just Adaptive.

Is there an aftermarket film for safety glass? Will research.

No mudflaps?  Available at the dealer.

**Notes: **

94A Side sensing system:    Includes BLIS, Sounds a chime when vehicle gets close to surrounding vehicles and objects.   Basically like a side facing parking sensor.

41H Engine Block Heater: For price seems worth it.  [Some discussion](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/blocker-heater-41h-really-needed.82841/#post-1076562).

65B Safety Glass: ([Worth it](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a28422725/car-windows-glass-aaa-unbreakable/)) (not available for cargo)

Radio Differences: 58Y (no NAV) vs 584 (yes NAV), Standard radio vs SYNC3 - SYNC3 has "car play" support.
