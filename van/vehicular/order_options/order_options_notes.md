We went into the vehicle ordering process with a few years of using a large camper van and awareness of some of the high-level ordering options.  Based on this, we had a few hard requirements:

* All Wheel Drive: This vehicle would spend a lot of time at the beach and needed some snow capability.  We've owned a wrangler and aren't kidding ourselves that this thing is going to be a rock crawler, but limited off road capability was a must.
* Extended Length: For two adults doing a week or two at a time we could make a regular length work.  For two adults, two cats, full time, an extended was a must for us.
* High Roof: Similar to the length, for more limited use we could make a medium roof work, but not for full time.
* Cruise Control (Adaptive): Van 1.0 didn't have cruise control.  So we knew at order-time we had to have cruise.  A years later, we'd modify that need to be adaptive cruise.
* BLIS: Driving a large vehicle sucks, especially in heavy traffic and metro areas.  We knew from Van 1.0's lack of blind spot aids that we wanted this for Van 2.0.  

We had a few softer requirements:
* Swivels: They vastly add to the usable space in a camper fan.  This is only soft due to aftermarket availability.
* Ecoboost: Based on our forum research and owning low-pickup vehicles, the Ecoboost was a strong preference for us.
* Slider and Rear Windows: This is soft requirement because you can add windows after order.  But we knew we wanted a slider window for driving visibility.  We cared more about having that from the get-go than installing an aftermarket window with vents down the road.
* Mudflaps: Turns out these are not options but can be purchased from the dealer separately.  We ended up going with an after market product for the rear.  We still haven't settled on an option for the front (the factory well liners and our lift and tire related mods make this non-trivial).

Some items we initially considered but ruled out:
* Dual Alternators: It sounds great and is probably and OK option if you go with a 12V house system.  Based on the unclear controls Ford employs for its use, a better option is a dedicated aftermarket 2nd alternator.  This allows use of more sophisticated controls like the wakespeed 500 that allow tailoring the alternator charge for LFP systems.  For a 24V system like ours, the second factory alternator is a net-negative since it inhibits our ability to install a usable 2nd alternator for direct charging.  We will note that the standard factory alternator is 250A, which is very capable on paper.
* Long Arm Side Mirrors: We thought these might help to eliminate blind spots.  The forum consensus was to [skip these](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/long-arm-side-mirrors-vs-short-arm-mirrors.81550/#post-1061335) unless you plan to do a lot of [long trailer towing](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/long-arm-mirrors-adjustable-from-short-to-long.3506/).  Years in, we would agree.  We're very happy we skipped them.

Some items we would have optioned, but were standard for our order year:
* Backup Camera: Aftermarket is a possibility, but factory options give much better integration.  For our order year, the backup camera is standard.
* 250A Alternator: 250A leaves a lot of power left over for customer use.
* Auto High Beam Headlights: We're so bad about turning off high beams we a hesitant to use them.  This capability is great for us.
* Lane Keeping: Fords system is OK.  We'd prefer lane centering but we'll take what we can get.
* Rain Sensing Windshield Wipers: Why not?


## Selected Options

Based on the rationale above and multiple detailed reviews of the ordering guide, we ended up with the following configuration for our order.  For the items below, * means we were on the fence, ** means we don't care but its included, nothing means we definitely wanted it.

| Code    | Description                                       | Notes                                                        |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 101A    | Cargo Van                                         |                                                              |
| W3U     | High Roof Transit-350 GVWR 9950 AWD 148" Extended | Bonus: This option includes the Heavy Duty Front Axle (41E).|
| 99G     | EcoBoost V6                                       | Bonus: With body code W3U, this option includes the 3.73 Limited Slip Rear Axle (X7L).|
| DR      | Avalanche Gray                                    | For summer heat absorption, we wanted as light as possible that isn't white.|
| 21T     | Dark Palazzo Gray Cloth, 4-way manual swivel      | Discounted if selected with Adventure Prep Package (47N).  Includes Dual AGM (63E).  We installed swivels on the Sprinter, so we considered aftermarket.  Ultimately, having safety rated swivels that don't increase the seat height convinced us to go this route.|
| 47N     | Adventure Prep Package                            | This included many options we were set on, and a few were didn't care about.  The price was about the same as the total for the options we wanted so we went with it.|
| 655     | Extended Range Fuel Tank                          | Minimize stops for fuel on long cross country trips.|
| 53B     | Heavy Duty Trailer Tow Package                    | Provides all the provisions for towing, which is certainly a possibility.  Also includes tow/haul mode, which we use all the time in the mountains.|
| 67D     | Trailer Brake Controller                          | Discounted if selected with the heavy duty trailer tow package (53B).  Can not add this after the fact.                                    |
| 67C     | Upfitter Package                                  | Discounted if selected with the Adventure Prep package (47N). Includes high capacity upfitter switches, large center console (67E) and Aux fuse panel with high spec interface (87E).  Provides a lot of flexibility for aftermarket wiring. |
| 86F     | Keys: 2 Additional                                | One fob lives in the bed area for locking and unlocking, and one for each of us.                                                        |
| 85A     | Rear Door Scuff Plate Kit                         | The only remaining piece of this is the sliding door step, which is mostly covered.  We might skip this one if we had to do it over.                                                               |
| 61D*    | Front/Rear Splitview                              | We've only used the front camera a handful of times.  This option does include rear and side sensors for parking, but those were included as part of the Adventure Prep Package.  We might skip this one if we had to do it over. Here is a [post](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/a-popular-hr-extended-cargo-van-arrives-at-matt-ford.81413/post-1059979) on backing up with it.  Here is [another post](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/2020-transit-front-rear-split-view-camera.78215/#post-1029072) with some additional information about it.                                                             |
| 65C*    | Power Sliding Door                                | We saw/see this as a reliability risk, but the idea of quietly and automatically closing the sliding door was very compelling after the multiple slam protocol to close the slider on Van 1.0                                                         |
| 41H*    | Engine Block Heater                               | Inexpensive to add at order time. Ford recommends it for temperatures below 10F which should be rare but possible for us. [Some forum discussion](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/blocker-heater-41h-really-needed.82841/#post-1076562).                                                           |
| 85D*    | Two Tone Horn                                     | Inexpensive and rumour is the standard horn is a joke.                                                                |
| 91B*    | Wiper Activated Headlamps                         | Inexpensive and a little safety.                                                             |
| 61C*    | Vehicle Maintenance Monitor                       | Indicates oil life and tire pressure on the Dash.  Inexpensive and has proven itself convenient.                                                     |

**Options that are Included Based on Packages or Other Selections or Standard**

| 41E   | Heavy Duty Front Axle                                | Included with W3U                                            |
| 96X   | 2 Passenger Seating                                  | Standard for Cargo                                           |
| 63E** | Dual AGM                                             | Included with four way swivel seats (21T) and with Adventure Prep Package (47N). |
| 642** | 16" Black Steel Wheel                                | Included with Adventure Prep Package (47N)                        |
| 55D** | Front Fog Lamps                                      | Included with Adventure Prep Package (47N)                        |
| 67E** | Large Center Console                                 | Included with Upfitter Package (67C) |
| 87E   | Aux Fuse Panel with High Interface Spec              | Included with Upfitter Package (67C) |
| 57E   | Modified Vehicle Wiring System and Kit               | Included with Upfitter Package (67C) |
| 90D** | Power Outlet                                         | Included with Adventure Prep Package (47N).                         |
| 87A** | Power Point (12V)                                    | Included with Adventure Prep Package (47N).                         |
| 43R   | Reverse Sensing System                               | Included with Adventure Prep Package (47N).  At order time we weren't sold on this but it was included.  12 months of use has us convinced it would be severely missed.                         |
| 94A   | Side Sensing System                                  | Included with Adventure Prep Package (47N).  At order time we weren't sold on this but it was included.  12 months of use has us convinced it would be severely missed.                      |
| 17B   | Fixed Rear Cargo Door Glass and Passenger Side Glass | Included with Adventure Prep Package (47N).                         |
| 65A   | BLIS                                                 | Included with Adventure Prep Package (47N).                         |
| 60D   | Adaptive Cruise                                      | Included with Adventure Prep Package (47N).  We initially questioned if adaptive cruise would function as normal cruise if the sensor was blocked/disabled.  The feedback we received is that normal cruise is a selectable subset of adaptive cruise (i.e. you don't need both options for this case).                       |
| 85C** | Illuminated Sun Visors                               | Included with Adventure Prep Package (47N).                         |

| 66D   | Front Overhead Shelf                                 | Included with Adventure Prep Package (47N).                         |
| 58Y*  | AM/FM Bluetooth, USB, SYNC3, 8" screen               | Included with Adventure Prep Package (47N).                         |
| 92E   | Privacy Glass                                        | Included with Adventure Prep Package (47N).                        |

Once we had our list well defined, we solicited feedback from in this [forum post](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/preparing-van-order-please-rate-comment-on-my-options.82838/#post-1076467).  Nothing we heard were deal breakers, so this is the list we went with for the order.

## Tips, Tricks, and Resources

* We recommend using a spreadsheet for this process. Ours is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GbHanoyVEuOgMkrxPkj72uFH5GokW-yG0rvje04YDuk/edit?usp=sharing).
* The [Transit Order Guide](2021-transit-order-guide.pdf) and [Price List](2021-cargo-price-list.pdf) are the documents you need (the correct year of course).
* Take your time and exercise heavy attention to detail.
