We plan to install an onboard air system for the following reasons:

- Airing up tires when returning to pavement
- Serving an airbag/load leveling system
- Inflating kites

Selection Criteria:

- 24V
- High low pressure flow rate (for inflating kite)

Options:

Viair has a million compressors, and several 24V models.  [This spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/114Yn1YWQaA4xqo_XdDko3Y5llOqwOqgbggMtzcdJ85E/edit?usp=sharing) summarizes their capabilities.

For our use case, the 24V version of the 400C looks like the preferred option.  It should be able to fill a kite in a minute or two.  It should also be sufficient to air up tires.  If need be, a dual compressor option version is possible.  Supply wires should be sized for the dual option (24 amps).

One open question is whether the airlift controllers or 3rd party controller for air suspension can be interfaced with an existing onboard air system.  TODO: Inquire with Air Lift.
