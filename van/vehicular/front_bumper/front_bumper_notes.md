[This post identifies a good product for animal protection](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/using-brush-guard-from-different-vehicle-on-ford-transit-250.82864/post-1077009).  At least one person was able to get a hitch receiver.  If it had recovery points it'd be perfect.

The Aluminess bumper is also under consideration.  We need to confirm that it is compatible with the adaptive cruise (and not just parking sensors).  Email sent.
