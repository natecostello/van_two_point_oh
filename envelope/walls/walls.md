In an effort to minimize any organic (read mold nuturing) materials, we are considering plastic as the basis for the walls.  The plan is to use a material similar to the stock wall panels that we had in our Sprinter upon reciept.   [Some discussion in this sprinter-source post](https://sprinter-source.com/forums/index.php?threads/43201/).

Possible candidates: 

[https://corrugatedplastics.net/4mmFlutedCorrugatedPlasticSheets.html](https://corrugatedplastics.net/4mmFlutedCorrugatedPlasticSheets.html) [Use described here on sprinter-source](https://sprinter-source.com/forums/index.php?threads/20471/#post-179129).  Samples of 500lb, 400lb, and 300lb material ordered on 11/17/20.

One concern is the ability to adhere things to the coroplast (HDPE).  This [post](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/coroplast-ceiling.79384/post-1042373) shows fabric over coroplast that used 3M90 and 3M headliner according to this [post](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/coroplast-ceiling.79384/post-1043258).  3M does suggest 90 will work with polyethylene.

The corrugated plastic sheet would be covered by a layer of closed cell neoprene (probably 1/8") and a fabric.  One fabric to consider is [marine vinyl](https://www.marinevinylfabric.com/products/marine-vinyl-fabric).  

### Adhesive compatibility

>**www.MarineVinylFabric.com:**
>​	Sorry for the delay I wanted to get you a good answer. Most customers have said the best adhesive is a HH66 vinyl cement.
>**Nathaniel Costello:**
>​	Great. Do you know if anyone has used 3M77 or 3M90 succesfully?
>**www.MarineVinylFabric.com:**

[3M80](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/~/3M-Rubber-And-Vinyl-80-Spray-Adhesive/?N=5002385+3293194236&rt=rud) literally looks like it was made to bond vinyl to neoprene.
