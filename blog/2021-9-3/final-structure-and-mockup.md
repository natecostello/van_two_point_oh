This is just a stub for now...

Finished final structural design (Thurs 8-26-2021)
Create BOM (Thurs 8-26-2021)
Wood Cuts (Tues 8-31-2021)
Mockup (Tues 8-31-2021, Thurs 9-2-2021, Friday 9-3-2021)

## Lessons Learned
We realized that we will assemble each side outside the van and install as a unit.
We added a few "temporary" pieces that will make assembly and movement easier.
We consolidated the galley and bed area of each side into one unit (with a continuous piece of 8020 on the upper-outside)

Refine structure (Sat 9-4-2021)
Finalize BOM (Sat 9-4-2021)
