We are adding addtional outlets at the base of the sink cabinet and in the passenger cabinet for the induction cooktop.


## Sink Cabinet Outlets

For the outlets at the base of the sink cabinet we will use a similar approach to the outlet under the van.

We will use two of [these outlets](https://www.amazon.com/Weatherproof-Journeyman-Pro-Receptacle-Integrated-Waterproof/dp/B07XF5D8HK) which will install easily in the 1/4 forward facing panel of the sink cabinet.  These will allow the recepticals to be easily disconnected if we want to remove that panel.  They will connect to a Y-splitter.  [This splitter](https://www.amazon.com/Kentek-Extension-Splitter-NEMA5-15P-NEMA5-15R/dp/B07KS4W56Q/) is 14AWG and is thus sized appropriately for the upstream breaker (15A).  The spliter will be fed with 14AWG marine triplex (extended from the existing AC outlet circuit) and terminated with [this receptical](https://www.amazon.com/Journeyman-Pro-Clamshell-Connector-Replacement-Commercial/dp/B08FCNF5KR).

## Induction Cooktop Outlets

We will use the same [outlet box](https://www.amazon.com/Carlon-Lamson-Sessons-B114RR-UPC-Single/dp/B002M5R97I) as the other two under cabinet outlets.  

Because this is a standalone circuit, the outlet should be GFCI since it doesn't have an upstream GFCI already.  We will use the same [GFCI outlet](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013OVCIPG/) as the garage outlet on the other circuit.

We will repurpose the vestigial wiring that powered the propane solenoid/oven.
