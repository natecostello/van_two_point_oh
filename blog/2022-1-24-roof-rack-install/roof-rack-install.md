Soph Installed roof brackets
We galled/cross threaded the bolt on one of the rear towers.  Replacement is an 18-8 all threaded 5/16 x length.

Notes:

Distance from forward mounting slot (center) of bracket-to-angle back to maxfan (with about 1/4 inch clearance to fan) is 107.75 inches.

Rich Solar Panels are 26.8 inches across (this is consistent and slightly conservative to measurement).

There will be a cross bar at front and back of solar panels.

This leads to a total stack of 26.8 x 4 + 1.5 x 2 = 110.2  We'll round up to 110.25.  In combination with the measurement of the forward mounting slot above would put the first hole in the two angle side rails at 2.5 inches (on center) from the fwd edge of the angle.

TODO:
Measure distance from inboard of slot to inboard of slot.  Verify distance is between: 56 5/8 and 56 7/8.  Distance must be less than 56 7/8 to allow drilling angle on center line of bottom face.

TODO:
Measure from forward mounting slot of bracket-to-angle to rear end of roof rack.  This number plus the 2.5 inches gives the total cut length for the angle.
