Soph Installed roof brackets
We galled/cross threaded the bolt on one of the rear towers.  Replacement is an 18-8 all threaded 5/16 x length.

Notes:

Distance from forward mounting slot (center) of bracket-to-angle back to maxfan (with about 1/4 inch clearance to fan) is 107.75 inches.

Rich Solar Panels are 26.8 inches across (this is consistent and slightly conservative to measurement).

There will be a cross bar at front and back of solar panels.

This leads to a total stack of 26.8 x 4 + 1.5 x 2 = 110.2  We'll round up to 110.25.  In combination with the measurement of the forward mounting slot above would put the first hole in the two angle side rails at 2.5 inches (on center) from the fwd edge of the angle.   

Max rack can be forward of first hole (on center) is 5.5 inches before potential interference with roof antenna.

**Given all this, we'll make it 3 inches from center of forward hole to forward edge of rack.**


Bracket measurements:
Top width 3.5 inches
Top "length" approximate: 1.75
Top hole/slot Spacing:  1.4 inner, 2.1 outer
Slot length: 23/32
Slot width: 11/32
Slot to athwart inner edge: 15/32
Thickness: 3/16
Bracket to bracket inner edge (as is) 56 1/4" another: 56 3/8"

Stackup measurements:
Actual length of 4 panels framed in 8020: 110 1/16-110 1/8
Drill Locations:
1.125 from inner edge for roof bracket holes

TODO:
Measure distance from inboard of slot to inboard of slot.  Verify distance is between: 56 5/8 and 56 7/8.  Distance must be less than 56 7/8 to allow drilling angle on center line of bottom face.

TODO:
Measure from forward mounting slot of bracket-to-angle to rear end of roof rack.  This number plus the 2.5 inches gives the total cut length for the angle.

Maeasured, mocked up in garage, and mark angle for drill locations for solar and roof brackets.

Note: for 5/16-18 into 2024-T4 Aluminum, this [site](https://www.torqueproductscanada.ca/torque_specs.html) and[fastenal](https://www.fastenal.com/content/merch_rules/images/fcom/content-library/Torque-Tension%20Reference%20Guide.pdf) guidance is 80 inch-pounds.  Yield on 6061-T6 is about 85% of 2024-T4 so we'll back off to like 65 inch-pounds.
