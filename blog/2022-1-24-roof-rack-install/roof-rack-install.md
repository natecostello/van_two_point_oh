Soph Installed roof brackets
We galled/cross threaded the bolt on one of the rear towers.

Notes:

Distance from forward mounting slot (center) of bracket-to-angle back to maxfan (with about 1/4 inch clearance to fan) is 107.75 inches.

Rich Solar Panels are 26.8 inches across (this is consistent and slightly conservative to measurement).

There will be a cross bar at front and back of solar panels.

This leads to a total stack of 26.8 x 4 + 1.5 x 2 = 110.2  We'll round up to 110.25.  In combination with the measurement of the forward mounting slot above would put the first hole in the two angle side rails at 2.5 inches (on center) from the fwd edge of the angle.
