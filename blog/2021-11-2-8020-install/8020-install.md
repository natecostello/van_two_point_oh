**TLDR: We built Van 2.0's structure with 15 series 8020 extruded aluminum based on its precision, strength, and popularity among DIY van conversion projects. Ordering cut-to-length and counter-bored pieces made assembly and install a breeze.**

This is all rough notes and draft prose.

2020-10-28:
Picked up 8020
Sorted and inventoried

2021-11-2
Started assemblying driver side 8020

2021-11-4
Fabricated a tool that will allow tightening the short sections (6")

2021-11-?
Finished driver side

2021-11-7
Assembled passenger side

20201-11-8
Fixed on missing 6 incher on driver - one to go
Removed extra piece and braced on passenger side
Loaded passenger side
Cut the long fore-aft pieces to length
Cut the rear-most athwart piece to length
Measured for wood.

2021-11-9
Picked up Okoume from annapolis (and pvc from homedepot)
Cut peices for the back of the structure

TODO: Remove 12V power point in back passenger side.

Notes:
Rear Cross member is 58+3 3/8 (can make 1/2 or drop to a quarter) = 61 3/8 - will round down to 61 1/4
Rear fore-aft length is cut to 70 inches (can tolerate stock on of 1/8-1/4)

13.5 + 3 3/8 lower edge of upper rail to top of wall 8020 - same at front of driver galley = 13 4/8 + 3 3/8 = 16 7/8 
20 3/8 + 3 3/8 inner edge of wheel well structure to inner edge fore-aft = 23 6/8 = 23 3/4

remove 12v power point in back pass side

2021-11-11
Soph removed 12V power point
Soph drilled and fitup the upper back pieces
Soph installed rear double angle brackets on fore-aft inner upper pieces

2021-11-12
Soph drilled and fitup the lower back pieces

Notes on Thru-bolting
Planning to use 3/8 ID 3/4 OD FR4 Tube for spacer through floor
Using 1/8 inch thick FR4 sheet for spacer above bracket
1/4 ID 3/4 OD Washer on outside
Grade 5 1/4-20 bolt 2.5 inches long zinc
1/4-20 Grade 5 lock nut zinc

Notes on Multiplus and SmartSolar Mounting
-Threaded fastners get super mixed review
-Tee Nuts on Van 1.0 were finicky but ok
-Planning to use M6 screw in tee nuts
-Ordering #7 1/2 wood screw to support

2015-11-14
Lots of time spent doing initial layout of electrical to make sure back panels make sense.
Decided to relocate espar to front to remove duct conflict

2021-11-15
Figured out holes and pass throughs
Partial final squaring of driver side
Lots of spent thought on panel mounting (plan to route mount areas down to 1/4")
May use drop in, may use screw in with drop in nuts, may use cut drilled brackets with threaded clips

2021-11-16
Maybe a new entry on panels
Added holes to back panels for wire pass through
fab'd tiny wheel well panel for transfer switch
3 coats of water based spar urethane on back panels

21-11-18:
sanded and added another coat to panels

21-11-18:
fab'd floor spacers (per below)

Through bolting spacer thickness update:

Assuming nominal foam dimension:

Length: 0.4in + 0.5 in + 12mm (BB) + 2mm (lon marine) = 22.86mm + 12mm + 2mm = 36.860mm = 1.4511811 in = 1 7.2/16 in

Assuming expanded pvc + VHB tapee
Length: 13/16 + 0.045 + 12mm + 2mm = 20.6375mm + 1.143mm + 12mm + 2mm = 35.781mm = 1.40870079 in = 1 6.5/16 in

Spacer should be 1 3/8 to 1 7/16.  Shoot for just over 1 3/8.

21-11-20:
added a brushed edge coat to all back panels just in case
squared driver side
installed vertial piece for electrical

21-12-2
added temp support for driver side
8020 torque guide lines:
http://fandl8020.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/EBN-Spring15.pdf
spoiler: 10-15 ft-lbs (call it 10 with loctite and angled drive)
started torquing and locktiting

21-12-3
torqing and locktiting

21-12-5
finished locktighting driver side

21-12-9
Realized that some back panel holes need to be opened/slotted based on the squaring process

21-12-11
Used dremel to open up holes
Installed Tee-nuts for multiplus (and screwed up mounting an inch high)
Tee-nuts protrude through slightly ~1/16 so we need a spacer on the bottom so the multiplus is bearing on the panel and not push out the tee nuts - looks like 3 layers of uhmw tape will be sufficient.  I'll add some to the back of the upper mount as well.

Considering spacing off the MPPT to give better airflow since now tight:
  Max we can space out is 1 inch to prevent aux mppt from being proud of structure.  M6 standoff max out at a stand off length of 51mm, so wont allow for 2nd MPPT.  1/4-20 options will work: [four of these](https://www.mcmaster.com/93620A194/) and [four of these](https://www.mcmaster.com/93620A035/) would work.  And we will need [these](https://www.mcmaster.com/90611A113/).  The four inch spacers are $$$ so we'll wait until we get that aux MPPT.  Alternatively we can use the 1/4-20 tee-nuts and 4 [3/4 inch spacers](https://www.mcmaster.com/92415A867/).  This leaves the other options available in the future. 

Ordered the spacers and tee-nuts for the MPPT

21-12-12
Installed Tee nuts for top brackets on rear panel
Installed spacer (4 layers uhmw tape) for the multplus
Installed lowest wheel-well panel
Ordered longer fasteners for the multplus and for the MPPT

21-12-13
Installed all rear panel fasteners except MPPT tee nuts

21-12-14
Installed MPPT tee nuts.  Ended up going with 5/16 hardware as the 1/4-20 tee nuts were wimpy.  Used a step bit to open up the holes in the MPPT.  Mounting design is: 5/16 screw in tee nut, panel, 1.25 inch fender washer, 0.75 inch spacer, 1.5 inch 5/16 wide flange button head screw.

21-12-16
