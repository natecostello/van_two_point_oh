**TLDR: We built Van 2.0's structure with 15 series 8020 extruded aluminum based on its precision, strength, and popularity among DIY van conversion projects. Ordering cut-to-length and counter-bored pieces made assembly and install a breeze.**

## Structure Assembly

We ordered our 8020 through a local-ish affiliate named PennAir.  When I originally called 8020 they recommended not ordering directly for such a large order.  PennAir was great to work with and made pickup super easy.  

![model and bom](model-bom.jpeg)
_We checked each piece of as we unloaded._

We spent the first night checking the delivery vs our BOM and found no issues.  We also put some masking tape on the smooth faces that would be exposed on the galley fronts.

![inventory](inventory.jpeg)
_A nice organized laydown area always makes things easier._

Early in the assembly, we found that we could not tighten the anchor fasteners in the short six inch cross members in the rear portions of the structure.  To solve this problem we cut a rounded hex key short and to use with a small ratchet.

_Every thing you need to know to make your own._

_Here you can see how it works and why its needed._

Assembly was quick, each side took maybe an hour or so.  The slowest part is just making sure everything stays square.  If we did this again, we would probably design some tooling to help with the holding pieces square during fitup and fastening rather than just using speed squares.

Another tip is to build it on a flat a surface as possible.  The garage floor we assembled on wasn't super flat which made keeping things square more difficult.

![assembling](assembling.jpeg)
_It gets a little more challenging to keep square once you break into that third dimension._

Here's our driver and passenger side timelapses for your viewing pleasure.

After assembling each side, in turn, we loaded them into the van for a trial fit.  The only interference we found was on the passenger side D-pillar power point.  We had no anticipated need for this power source, but we relocated it to the D-Pillar access panel.

![driver side fit](driver-trial-load.jpeg)

When we designed the structure, there were a few locations/dimensions that we didn't want to fix in advance.  One of these was the length of the in-board upper fore-aft pieces in the garage.  We wanted the pieces to end as close to the rear doors as possible while supporting an athwart cross piece that spans between the D-pillars.  We ordered these intentionally long, and then once the two assemblies were loaded, we measured in place, removed and cut these two pieces.  Then we were able to measure and cut that rear-most athwart piece.  We could now close the rear doors again.

After the test loads we moved on to final squaring and torquing.  One side at a time, and one joint at a time, interatively, we went back and carefully squared each each structure.  This was time consuming.  Once we had a structure fully squared, we'd use extra brackets to support a single joint, remove each fastener one at a time, add loc-tite, and torque.  Based on [this guide](ebn-spring15.pdf), we settled on 10 ft-lbs.  Then we'd remove the support and move on.  This was also time consuming.  In hindsight with better jigs and squaring tools, we probably could have done all the squaring as part of initial assembly.  While this process was ongoing, we began working on the panels that would fasten to the backside of each assembly.

## Backside Panels

On the driver side we knew that the MPPT and Multiplus would need a surface to mount on, so decided to fasten 1/2" Okoume plywood to the backside of the structure.  Our use of the half-height wall 8020 gives enough space on the backside of the structure for these panels (it also allows the structure to clear the inward curvature of the van).

We opted to extend these panels beyond the electrical area to include the garage area.  Our thinking was that this would give us flexibility to mount/restrain garage items against that panel, keep objects from dropping behind the structure, and provide rigidity to the structure while moving it around ahead of bolting to the wall and through the floor.  For these reasons we included these panels on the passenger side too.

In hindsight, for weight reasons, we'd probably use aluminum stock to mount the electrical components and use PennLight as a backing materials.  This would save approximately 13 lbs (and a lot of urethane and time).  We haven't used the backside panels for restraining gear, and temporary structure could be employed for temporary rigidity.

We cut the panels, drilled the holes and features for attachment and access, and then sprayed four coats of water-based spar urethane (our default treatment for all wood used in the build).

We spent a lot of time figuring out how to mount the electrical equipment in a way that was secure but removable without access to the backside.  We had ok experience with tee-nuts on Van 1.0, so we used them.  However, we opted for the screw in variants to ensure they were more secure.

![backside panel](back-panel.jpeg)
_In the middle of this image you can see six brass colored M6 screw in tee-nuts.  These receive the fasteners for the Multiplus mounting bracket and the two fasteners at the bottom of the Multiplus.  Along the top of the panel are additional 5/16" screw in tee-nuts for additional attachment points of the panel to the structure via 8020 gusseted brackets.  All other attachments are just 5/16 fasteners, fender washers, and drop-in t-nuts._

Rear fore-aft length is cut to 70 inches (can tolerate stock on of 1/8-1/4)

13.5 + 3 3/8 lower edge of upper rail to top of wall 8020 - same at front of driver galley = 13 4/8 + 3 3/8 = 16 7/8 
20 3/8 + 3 3/8 inner edge of wheel well structure to inner edge fore-aft = 23 6/8 = 23 3/4

remove 12v power point in back pass side

2021-11-11
Soph removed 12V power point
Soph drilled and fitup the upper back pieces
Soph installed rear double angle brackets on fore-aft inner upper pieces

2021-11-12
Soph drilled and fitup the lower back pieces

Using 1/8 inch thick FR4 sheet for spacer above bracket
1/4 ID 3/4 OD Washer on outside
Grade 5 1/4-20 bolt 2.5 inches long zinc
1/4-20 Grade 5 lock nut zinc

Notes on Multiplus and SmartSolar Mounting
-Threaded fastners get super mixed review
-Tee Nuts on Van 1.0 were finicky but ok
-Planning to use M6 screw in tee nuts
-Ordering #7 1/2 wood screw to support

2015-11-14
Lots of time spent doing initial layout of electrical to make sure back panels make sense.
Decided to relocate espar to front to remove duct conflict

2021-11-15
Figured out holes and pass throughs
Partial final squaring of driver side
Lots of spent thought on panel mounting (plan to route mount areas down to 1/4")
May use drop in, may use screw in with drop in nuts, may use cut drilled brackets with threaded clips

2021-11-16
Maybe a new entry on panels
Added holes to back panels for wire pass through
fab'd tiny wheel well panel for transfer switch
3 coats of water based spar urethane on back panels

21-11-18:
sanded and added another coat to panels

21-11-18:
fab'd floor spacers (per below)

Through bolting spacer thickness update:

Assuming nominal foam dimension:

Length: 0.4in + 0.5 in + 12mm (BB) + 2mm (lon marine) = 22.86mm + 12mm + 2mm = 36.860mm = 1.4511811 in = 1 7.2/16 in

Assuming expanded pvc + VHB tapee
Length: 13/16 + 0.045 + 12mm + 2mm = 20.6375mm + 1.143mm + 12mm + 2mm = 35.781mm = 1.40870079 in = 1 6.5/16 in

Spacer should be 1 3/8 to 1 7/16.  Shoot for just over 1 3/8.

21-11-20:
added a brushed edge coat to all back panels just in case
squared driver side
installed vertial piece for electrical

21-12-2
added temp support for driver side
8020 torque guide lines:
http://fandl8020.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/EBN-Spring15.pdf
spoiler: 10-15 ft-lbs (call it 10 with loctite and angled drive)
started torquing and locktiting

21-12-3
torqing and locktiting

21-12-5
finished locktighting driver side

21-12-9
Realized that some back panel holes need to be opened/slotted based on the squaring process

21-12-11
Used dremel to open up holes
Installed Tee-nuts for multiplus (and screwed up mounting an inch high)
Tee-nuts protrude through slightly ~1/16 so we need a spacer on the bottom so the multiplus is bearing on the panel and not push out the tee nuts - looks like 3 layers of uhmw tape will be sufficient.  I'll add some to the back of the upper mount as well.

Considering spacing off the MPPT to give better airflow since now tight:
  Max we can space out is 1 inch to prevent aux mppt from being proud of structure.  M6 standoff max out at a stand off length of 51mm, so wont allow for 2nd MPPT.  1/4-20 options will work: [four of these](https://www.mcmaster.com/93620A194/) and [four of these](https://www.mcmaster.com/93620A035/) would work.  And we will need [these](https://www.mcmaster.com/90611A113/).  The four inch spacers are $$$ so we'll wait until we get that aux MPPT.  Alternatively we can use the 1/4-20 tee-nuts and 4 [3/4 inch spacers](https://www.mcmaster.com/92415A867/).  This leaves the other options available in the future. 

Ordered the spacers and tee-nuts for the MPPT

21-12-12
Installed Tee nuts for top brackets on rear panel
Installed spacer (4 layers uhmw tape) for the multplus
Installed lowest wheel-well panel
Ordered longer fasteners for the multplus and for the MPPT

21-12-13
Installed all rear panel fasteners except MPPT tee nuts

21-12-14
Installed MPPT tee nuts.  Ended up going with 5/16 hardware as the 1/4-20 tee nuts were wimpy.  Used a step bit to open up the holes in the MPPT.  Mounting design is: 5/16 screw in tee nut, panel, 1.25 inch fender washer, 0.75 inch spacer, 1.5 inch 5/16 wide flange button head screw.

21-12-16
Started squaring passenger side

21-12-17
Finished squaring passenger side
Started loctite on passenger side

21-12-18
Finished locktiting passenger side
Slotted holes on rear panel

21-12-19
Bolted up rear panels

2021-12-15
Moved the driver side 8020 into the van
Made some wall panel tweaks
Installed wall brackets
Drilled 4 holes
Primed 4 holes

2021-12-16
Fabbed floor brackeets
Through-bolted structure to floor
Loctited and torqued structure to wall 8020
Soph finalized wall panel tweaks and installed

2021-12-19
