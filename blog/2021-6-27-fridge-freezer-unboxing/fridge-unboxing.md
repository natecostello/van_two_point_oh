**TLDR: This is Sophia's first *post*.  It describes our unboxing... which is very great and interesting.**  

I could go on and on and on and on... but first I would like to offer more details on how to open a box.

## How to Open a Box

First you get a box, and then you cut a hole in the box.  Hopefully there is a Vitrifrigo refrigerator in it, otherwise you will get an awful surprise!!!

And then you will want to know... some more things about removing tape.
