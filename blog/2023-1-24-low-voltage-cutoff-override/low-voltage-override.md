considering [this switch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F1D52YS/) wired across the BMS internal relay to override BMS and close main contactor to allow resumption of charging after a low voltage cutoff.

Would prefer an audible alarm while switch is in override configuration to avoid accidentally leaving it there, this would require running a wire back to ground as well.
