Notes:
Kit include 18ft of lines.

Unit will fit on the upper wall L-track in rear most driver side, if overhead bag moves forward about 3 inches, and we compress that side.  Alternatively, could find 24" bag.  This will allow running lines up through floor in garage shelf region, behind wall panel, out around side of wall panel and into the unit.

We will route cooling lines through floor in garage, then up through shelves, and out aft facing panel near top on driverside, then up adjacent to the D-pillar.
