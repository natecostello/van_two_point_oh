Notes:
Kit include 18ft of lines.

Unit will fit on the upper wall L-track in rear most driver side, if overhead bag moves forward about 3 inches, and we compress that side.  Alternatively, could find 24" bag.  This will allow running lines up through floor in garage shelf region, behind wall panel, out around side of wall panel and into the unit.

We will route cooling lines through floor in garage, then up through shelves, and out aft facing panel near top on driverside, then up adjacent to the D-pillar.

Hose Length:
compressor (outer wall) to frame 13.5"
frame event with compressor to bumper: 155.75"
frame back to outer wall 13.5"
outer wall at floor to top of evap: 77"
Total: 21.8ft - will buy 25 ft.

Hose Diameter (outer):
#6 - 39/64
#10 - 25/32

Wire Length:
Taxicab battery to compressor 120" with margin.  Adding 24" to be sure.  Will order 12 ft.  ABYC predicted vdrop is 1.5% at max current.  Need to figure out lug size for compressor.

Terminal size:  Compressor terminals are 1/4" per email with undermount AC.
