Previously had been looking at the [Panasonic EVP132 400W](https://a1solarstore.com/panasonic-400w-solar-panel-132-cell-evp132gl.html) which are 71.7 x 40 x 1.2 in, 45lbs, but they now show out of stock

Max length is 75.8"
Max Width is 42.375"

Fits:

[Q Cells 400W](https://a1solarstore.com/q-cells-400w-solar-panel-132-cell-q.peak-duo-blk-ml-g10.html) 74 x 41.1 x 1.26 in, 48.5lbs, $414.17

Looks like shipping is $250 or pickup in Pompano FL (on the way from key west to tampa)

[REC 405W](https://a1solarstore.com/rec-405w-solar-panel-132-cell-rec405aa-pure.html) 	71.7 x 40 x 1.2 in, 45 lbs, $531.44

Looks like shipping is $250

Smart Solar 100/30 is sufficient.  Cold protection is via CAN/V.Direct (and manual), HV is via CAN and Main Contactor cut off.

Would need bracket design for MPPT and Solar storage
would need low side wiring to be sized to existing protected wireing
Would need V.direct cable

Need to think about ground restraint/angling in wind.
