We recieved our cells in late May, but haven't had a chance to actually open them.  Today was the day.

Physically they all look good.  My calipers needed new batteries, so we'll update this later once we can take detailed measurements.  One area of interest is the flat region around the studs as that will limit current flow area into/out-of the cells.

Also, you can hear the electrolyte moving around.  According to a moderator on the diysolarpower forum, this is normal for EVE cells.

Then we kited the Chesapeake Bay.
