TL;DR: Weldwood Contact Adhesive can be used to successfully stick neoprene to CoreRigid corrugated ABS panels.  This means, we have identified a suitable alternative to plywood for our interior wall panels.

On a cool day in the fall of 2019 and four years into our first vanbuild, we were finally moved to install the plumbing in Van 1.0.  We removed the plywood panels of the bed platform to access the garage space below.  In the process we discovered little black constellations of mildew that had big-banged there way across the garage night sky / bottom side of the bed platform.  We knew mold would happen since the garage was home to warm, wet kiteboarding gear, but we also took a mental note: limit organic materials in future builds.

Much like the last time around, our building envelope will consist of (from outside to inside): van wall, sound deadener, Thinsulate, and wall panel.  The wall panel itself will consist of (from outside to inside): rigid wall material glued to neoprene glued to a wall covering.  The objective has been to replace 1/4 plywood with corrugated plastic for the rigid wall material.  This design does not work if you can't stick the neoprene to the rigid wall material.  Some lovely, inorganic wall panel candidates, such as high density poly ethylene (HDPE), are too "low surface energy," meaning little sticks to them.  Think of this as the satisfying feeling you have when you easily pull a plastic label off a cutting board or plastic bottle vs. the mess and frustration of sitting alone at a bar wpicking a paper label off a glass beer bottle.  Let's just go with that.  You want that stick, and not all materials are gonna give you this.

As an alternative to HDPE, Nate found 4' x 8' sheets of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) panels.  The brand name is [CoreRigid](https://www.penn-elcom.com/pdf/CoreRigid%20-%20Penn%20Elcom.pdf) and Penn Elcom sells them for building flight cases.  Here's a decription of the material, "CoreRigid composite panels are a plywood alternative formulated too offer exceptional performance a thigh temperatures while delivering robust strengthvandvstiffness properties Created by layering two tough ABS sheets arounda semi-hollow innercore, they retain the performance of plywood while also resisting chemical splashes and thermal distortion."

The product looked and felt great, but its stickiness was unknown.  To test the material, I followed the instructions on our gallon of Weldwood Contact Adhesive, thinly coating a swatch of neoprene and the CoreRigid sample with glue.  I waited a few minutes, pressed these faces together, and waited an hour.  We had adhesion!  In trying to pick apart the neoprene from the CoreRigid, I was happy to discover the bond was stronger than the neoprene itself.  The next day I subjected the little sandwich to the elements to see if heat would break the bond.  It didn't get quite as hot as I'd hoped, but still, no slip.  Several days later, and we still have a winner.  

I am pleased to share we are one step closer to ahieveing an anti-mold mobile.  We have identified a plywood substitute for our wall panels and an adhesive that properly bonds it to the neoprene insualation we're using.  Next stop Jersey... shipping is no joke!
