On Van 1.0 we installed a standard RV shorepower plug on the driver side of the van.  It worked fine, but it does involve putting a hole in the side of the van.  It also got damaged by an uncontrolled rear door opening while the cover was flipped up.  For Van 2.0, we have an opportunity to improve.

The transit has two rectangular ports underneath the bumper structure.  They are easy to get to, and out of the way of weather and doors.  [DaveInSeattle](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/members/daveinseattle.88366/) made brilliant use of one of these ports to install his shorepower and aux solar connection.  We decided to do the same.

We'll be using a SmartPlug for our shorepower connection.  It allegedly improves on the standard screw lock plugs.  We'll see.  We opted for the shiny stainless variant.  Also like Dave, we'll use the same port for our aux solar connection (for a future moveable, ground based array).  We opted for [this SAE power socket](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XLK4CH3?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details).

Sophia spent some quality time crawling around under the van with cardboard and calipers.  She figured out a way to arrange the Smartplug, the power socket, and four future plusnuts in spite of Ford's constraints.  This freed up the second port for an exterior plug (more later).

_Cardboard is the true van conversion hero._

Once we were satisfied that everything fit, I finished the design in Fusion 360.

While I was at it, I when ahead and designed a second plate for the adjacent rectangular port that will house an [exterior plug](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SLM8LT5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), now that I knew it wouldn't be needed for the aux solar connection.  This was much more straight forward.

Lastly, we sent the designs off to sendcutsend.  We ordered them in 1/8 aluminum which should be plenty stout and corrosion resistant.  The total for both plates was $19 even.  Not bad.

## Other Useful Things

Its always great when you can find dimensioned drawings from manuafacturers!
