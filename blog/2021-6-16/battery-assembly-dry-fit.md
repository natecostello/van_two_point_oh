We are doing a trial of the battery assembly to make sure we can get good final dimensions (primarily for cell interconnections) and verify physical the design works.

Step 1:  Cover the metal portions of the structure with kapton tape.

Step 2:  Pair the cells by thier internal resistance provided by the supplier.  Per X on the diysolarpower forum, we should use the "Ri1" values to do this.  We sorted the data and grouped them accordingly.

Step 3:  Cover the outer sides of the paired cells with kapton tape.
