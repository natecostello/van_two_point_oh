Testing with aluminet in shade mode:
* Kapton tape and emissivity set to .95
2022-7-27 Test 1223
* Sun exposed 110.6F
* Aluminet Shaded 86.7F
* Fully Shaded 74.8F (ambient)


Q = UAdT

Q2/Q1 = UAdT2/UAdT1 = dT2/dT1

In the above case, if interior temp is being maintained at 70F, the dT1 = 41F, dT2 = 17F which translates to a reduction in heat input to 41% of Q1 or a reduction by 59%.

In the case of wind, U can increase by 50x over natural convection

Q2 = UAdT2
Q1 = 50UAdT1

Assuming Q1=Q2 since the heat input from solar radiation is unchanged in this case:

Q2/Q1 = 1 = 50dT2/dT1

dT1 = 41F

dT2 = dT1/50 ~ 1F
