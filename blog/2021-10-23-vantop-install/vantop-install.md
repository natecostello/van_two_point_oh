One Forum Member's approach:
'...looks like I will use the body control module fuse box since there are several 15A fuse locations available. 14, 15 & 29 are constant on. 36 is ignition on.

Later he says:

'For constant on use Body Control module fuse No 29 (15A) labeled not used; no29 is a micro fuse. For ignition on use fuse no 18 on driver side fuse box it is a 20A fuse also labeled "not used".'

BCM Notes:

All fuses appear to have power at all times except:
#30 never has power (even when running)

Ended up just following they same steps as the forum. (29 in BCM) (5 in driver side fuse box)

1021-10-23:
installed the and routed power and rear camera
routed power up the a-pillar, behind headliner, and through the forward camera moulding
see picks for dash removal
turns out the 2021 is not the same as Gregoryx's brake light assembly, thus ordered a cable gland kit

2021-10-24:
Turns out fuse 18 on the driver side fuse box is now in use.  Changed ACC power  to fuse 7.
Mounted rear camera on brake light, and drilled assembly and routed thorugh it.  Will add cable gland later.

Fuse 7 location is actually dead.  Switched to fuse 5.

re wiring.  only using ACC power (don't need parked cam since usually blocked anyway).
rain delay
after finishing wiring, realized the converter I bought is USB micro and not USB mini (for vantop).  Doh!
Buttoned up, will order right angle micro to mini adapter once in key  west

??
Recieved and installed mini adapter

2022-1-??:
Vantop stopped working.  Also had noticed that while it was working, we were having issues with ford sync screen not turning on. Need to investigae
