We implemented several lessons learned based on the [first trial](blog/2021-7-26/electroplating-trials).  These included:

* A glass 4x8x8 inch glass vase from amazon to hold our plating bath and increase spacing between the parts and anodes.  
* Using shot glasses and a chopped up UHMW cutting board as ballast so we didn't have to use quite as much electrolyte to get the fluid level deep enough in the bath.   
* Keeping alligator clips out of the electrolyte. We formed some heavy gauge copper wire to make a "rack" to hold the bus bar being plated.  We bent the nickel anodes and made the electrical connection above the fluid level.  
* Doubling the area of the nickel electrodes.
* A cheap aquarium heater for circulation.  We bought a heater but didn't use it.

We ended up doing lots of experimentation on the prepping/cleaning front.  If you want the recipe that worked skip to the end.  If you want the full story, read on.

We started off using the following protocol:
* scrub with dawn dish soap and rinse
* boil in a salt and vinegar solution for a few minutes
* rinse
* plate

Initial results were an improvement, and consistent.  Clearly the alligator clip contamination theory holds.  However, we still saw a lot of variation and cloudy areas.  There always seemed to be some cloudy patches around the holes, where we are most concerned about good electrical contact.

TODO: Insert image of first attempts.

We embarked on many variations of the prep including multiple boil stages, eliminating salt (residue being one theory for the cloudy patches), and insane 20-minute scrubs with dawn to degrease (another theory for the cloudy patches).

_Cloudy holes.  No bueno._

No love.  We broke out our old Van 1.0 rust remediation drill/die-grinder scotchbrite pads to really scrub, and added some isopropyl.

_Even with all the abrasive cleaning, still cloudy holes._

Better but still seeing a little bit of cloudiness around some of the holes.  So I called in a life line.  A materials science buddy consulted his alchemical texts...


Below is the *E. Harms Memorial Nickel Plating Copper Prep Protocol* (EHMNPCPP):
* Dunk bus bar in hydrochloric (aka muriatic) acid
* Let sit for about 5 minutes, moving it around a few times
* Rinse
* Dunk and swirl in distilled water
* Dunk and swirl in de-ionized water

And then plate.  We just needed stronger chemicals.
