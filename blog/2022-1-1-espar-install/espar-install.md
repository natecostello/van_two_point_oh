identified the location for the espar and drill location.
verified intake spacing per manual (30mm)

Soph drilled the 5 inch espar hole (and large electrical/wakespeed pass through holes)
Primed all holes
Installed plate (with screws and vhb)
Urethaned bottom of plate
Soph caulked edges
We installed heater (nuts we used were 10mm flat-to-flat - so probably M6)

Notes on tank drop:

Dropped tank and installed espar pickup.
Used ramps to gain clearance.
Very difficult to locate where it won't interfere with connectors on top of sender and float (and nut can be tightly threaded on).  Used location similar to gregoryx.  Should have looked under sender first.
Intended to cut 2.5 inches off following gregorx, but saw kicked and bend standpipe, so cut back to un bent portion, resulting in a total of 4 inches vs 2.5 inches cut off.  This proably puts us near 1/4 tank cut off , but will ultimately test.



[Sprinter source on pump polarity](https://sprinter-source.com/forums/index.php?threads/46748/): It doesn't matter.

Looking at various install instructions: There seems to be a lot of variability in the kits for fuel line size, color, adapter size, hose clamp size...etc.  But in the end it all worked.
