It's generally good practice to test equipment that you will depend on for protection.  Given the cost and stored energy in our battery system, we decided to excersise the key protections provided by the BMS before we actually hook it up for initial charge (when we would be counting on said protections).  Aside from testing the protections it also can illuminate unadvertised behaviors that are worth understanding.

We also thought this would be a good project to tie together some of the past work we've done to work up control and monitoring python code.  Lastly we decided to explore Python's unittesting suite as the tool to implement this testing.  Understand, this kind of job is NOT what that suite is meant for, but why not.

Spoiler: The REC did fine and performs pretty much as described in the manual except for some minor findings.

## Supporting Code

The following custom dependencies are used by the test code:
* [ShayBox/Riden](https://github.com/ShayBox/Riden): A faster, improved, more-thread-friendly evolution of [Baldanos/rd6006](https://github.com/Baldanos/rd6006) used to control the DC power supply used for the test.
* [natecostello/instrument_logger](https://github.com/natecostello/instrument_logger):  This module provides an inherited `Instrument` interface for all instruments and devices in the testing and provides logging for them all.
* [natecostello/riden-status](https://github.com/natecostello/riden-status): This module provides monitoring for the DC power supply.  It inherits the `Instrument` interface and wraps Shaybox's class.
* [natecostello/rec_bms_status](https://github.com/natecostello/rec_bms_status): This module provides monitoring for the CANBUS and Binary outputs of the REC BMS.  It inherits the `Instrument` interface.

## Test Code

[natecostello/rec-bms-autotesting](https://github.com/natecostello/rec-bms-autotesting) contains all the test scripts.  It also includes a crude dataprocessing script that will produce readable plots from the CSV files generated by the test scripts.

There are four test scripts that test the BMS response to the following conditions:
* Rising Cell/Battery Voltage
* Falling Cell/Battery Voltage
* Rising Cell/Battery Temperature
* Falling Cell/Battery Temperature

## Test Hardware

The hardware used/required for the testing (as we went about it) includes:
* Riden RD6018 DC Power Supply
* REC Q BMS
* Logging Raspberry Pi 4 with a CANBus hat (running all this code)
* Battery Simulator

Together, these parts combine like Voltron to form the M. Henneberger Memorial Van 2.0 Battery Management System Compatibility Test Facility or MHMV2BMSCTF for short.

## Results

### Rising Cell/Battery Voltage

The purpose of this test is to verify the BMS takes protective action to communicate via CANBus to stop charging, to communicate via the CHARGE ENABLE to stop charging, and finally open the main contactor as a last resort to stop charging.  Also, we care whether it does these things at the voltage thresholds it's supposed to.  It did. [CSV data](rising_voltage_test.csv)


### Falling Cell/Battery Voltage
The purpose of this test is to verify the BMS takes protective action to communicate via CANBus to stop discharging and to open the main contactor as a last resort to stop discharging.  Also, we care whether it does these things at the voltage thresholds it's supposed to.  It did. [CSV data](falling_voltage_test.csv)

### Rising Cell/Battery Temperature
The purpose of this test is to verify the BMS takes protective action to communicate via CANBus to stop charging and discharging, communicate via the CHARGE ENABLE to stop charging, and finally open the main contactor as a last resort to stop everything.  Also, we care whether it does these things at the temperature thresholds it's supposed to.  It did. [CSV data](rising_temperature_test.csv)

### Falling Cell/Battery Temperature
The purpose of this test is to verify the BMS takes protective action to communicate via CANBus to stop charging, communicate via the CHARGE ENABLE to stop charging if temperature gets near freezing.  It did.  Note, the BMS does not open the main contactor on low temperature (nor would you want it to). [CSV data](rising_temperature_test.csv)
