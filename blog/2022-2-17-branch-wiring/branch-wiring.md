Set positive busbar heights (per procedure below)
Installed positive busbar on battery floor panel
Installed super velcro on battery floor panel

Procedure for setting positive busbar heights:

1. Measure height of shunt from base (H-shunt=33mm).  We want this to equal the height of the top surface of the fuse on the terminal.
2. Measure thickness of fuse (T-fuse=1mm).
3. Measure thickness of pos bus (T-bar=5mm).
4. Measure thickness of lower washer (T-washer=1.5mm)

For each fuse holder:

1. Apply loctite to base of stud and tightly snug down bottom nut on input and output terminals. Allow lockite to set (in front of heater for 30min).

For each output terminal of each fuse holder:

1. Set height of top of middle nut measured from base to (H-shunt - T-fuse - T-washer = 30.5mm) on each output terminal.

2. Raise middle nut two turns and apply loctite to stud threads below nut.  Lower middle nut two turns and verify height of middle nut is 30.5mm.  Allow loctite to set (in front o fheater for 1 hr).

For each input terminal of each fuse holder:

1. Set height of top of middle nut measured from base to (H-shunt - T-fuse - Tbar - T-washer = 25.5mm) on each input terminal.

2. Raise middle nut two turns and apply loctite to stud threads below nut.  Lower middle nut two turns and verify hieght of top of middle nut is 25.5mm. Allow loctite to set (in front off heater 1 hr).

Lastly:

Let set overnight in front of heater.
