Straightened Plus-nuts
One spinner, sophia was able to remove with dremel.  TBD on installing a new one.
Fitup upper wall L-track
Center scribed two pieces
Cut driver and passenger side to length
Drilled first hole
installed and used transfer screws to mark
Punched intersections
Drilled on the drill press
Fit check


Will have to dremel/mill out a few areas to pass the capscrew.

Notes on lower wall L-track:
The lower row will extend 5 inches rear-ward of the upper row.  This will line up the attachment points from top to bottom and give about 1/4 inch margin at the rear (can still swing to mark holes with transfer screws).

The same position will be used for the ceiling L-track, also lining up the mounting holes.

Cut ceiling and lower wall L-track to length.
Finished match drilling the ceiling L-track.
Will pickup and cut some angle to fabricate rear attachment bracket
Found rear-most holes (Ford's) are shifted toward passenger side by like 1/16.  Thankfully aluminum is compliant enough to bend.

Notes:
General method for L-track:

Center scribe
Measure location of rear most hole, measure and cross scribe
Punch intersection
Drill on drill press
bolt up through rear hole

install transfer screw in a middle-ish plus-nut
pivot l-track on rear bolt to cross scribe

take down 
punch intersection
drill on drill press

install rear and middle-ish bolt for accuracy check
remove rear bolt

for remaining holes moving out from middle:
install transfer screw
pivot l-track on centeer bolt to cross scribe

after all holes scribed
take down
punch intersections
drill on drill press

See photo series that lays out the process
