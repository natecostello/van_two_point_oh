One spinner, sophia was able to remove with dremel.  TBD on installing a new one.
Fitup upper wall L-track
Center scribed two pieces

Drilled first hole
installed and used transfer screws to mark
Punched intersections
Drilled on the drill press
Fit check

Will have to dremel out a few areas to pass the capscrew.

Notes on lower wall L-track:
The lower row will extend 5 inches rear-ward of the upper row.  This will line up the attachment points from top to bottom and give about 1/4 inch margin at the rear (can still swing to mark holes with transfer screws).

The same position will be used for the ceiling L-track, also lining up the mounting holes.
