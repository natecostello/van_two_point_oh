Installed the aluminess rear carriers.

Thoughts:  

No torque specs, including for factory hardware like the hinge bolts.  When called they just said, tight.  Surprising for automotive load carrier.
Instructions not super clear (brakets on insiide our outside of carrier. and hard to read.  protective tape use was vague, and should probably include both hinges.  Pay for printing, or point to online resource.  didn't specify fastener types, so difficult to need for anti-seeze.
Missing washers for passenger side center bracket fasteners.   Luckiliy had some stainless washers on hand.
Need to find out what main fasteners are grade wise, to determine final torque.


Still need to install tire carrier adapter shiz.
