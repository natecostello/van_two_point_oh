On 2022-7-10 we observed a cutoff event upon starting the van.  System restarted without hitting 100% and charging occured via solar limited by max voltage of 28.1.  Some balance occured as a result.  The next charging event occured on the 12th, once SOC dropped to > 40% where we have SOCH set.  No alternator charge occured.  Upon inspecting the unit it was flashing an error code corresponding to BMS notifying of cutoff.  Had to power cycle BMS to resume operation.  See files related to this.
