Identified Engine RPM discrepancy.  Based some [forum discussion](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/seeking-idle-rpm-data-and-crankshaft-pulley-effective-diameter.90608/) identified that crank pulley should be 6" and thus ratio needed adjustment.

Created v1.1 wakespeed file to correct ratio discrepancy and bump up field current by about 20%.

Installed v1.1 configuration.
