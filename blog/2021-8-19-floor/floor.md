You will find many many many approaches and strong opinions on how to do a van floor.  There is no real consensus on the forums.  We opted to heavily leverage the far-out-ride approach.

## Objectives

1. Minimize area of strong thermal bridging with metal fasteners (ie bolting down the floor).
2. Minimize area of weak thermal bridging with wood or wood like supports between base metal floor and plywood subfloor.
3. One contiguous, seamless, waterproof top surface, fully sealed at all edges.
4. Silent
5. Solid

## Design

To accomplish these goals, our design consists of:
* 0.4 inch minicell foam cut to fill the factory corrogations
* 0.5 inch minicell foam over the first minicell layer and corrogations
* 1/2 baltic birch plywood, primed and sealed, on top of the minicell
* Lonseal marine flooring on top of the minicell
* Foam or caulk or something to fill the edges around the plywood
* Caulk or something to form a fillet between the top of the Lonseal and the van factory wall

Simple, right?  Well, the devil is in the details.

## Concerns
* Keeping seams between plywood sheets from "popping" though the lonseal layer
* Keeping edges of the plywood from popping up.
* Taking care of the above concerns, while being reasonably easy to install, and not compromising on objectives 1 and 2.


## Implementation

We measured 3 times, and cut a test width of plywood to make sure it fit well at all locations along the van.  Once we were confident in that dimension we cut four sheets of plywood to the length.  We determined the optimal positions for the athwart seams and cut the four pieces to reflect that measurement.  We used ram-board to create a tempalate for the driver side to cut around the wheel well and other protrusions in the van.  We then cut the final shape of the plywood pieces according to the template and did a round of iterative fit-checks and trims.  See related lesson below.  We then primed and painted the plywood to limit moisture absorption.

We measured and cut the first layer of minicell using a box cutter and straight edge.  Easy.  We did try a leather strip cutter based on a facebook recommendation but it didn't work our for us.

We used weldwood landue to adhere the first layer of minicell strips to the van sheet metal.  This is somewhat necessary just to keep the pieces from flopping around during subsequent steps.  Easy.  We then laid in the top layer of mini-cell.  We didn't feel this layer required adhesive to stay in place.

We dryfit the plywood pieces once the minicell was in place.  We found that with the plywood had some squeaks due to slight movement of the plywood when weighted near the edges, due to the minicell compression, in locations where it contacted the van wall.  Based on that discovery, we did another round of small cuts to ensure the plywood had a small clearance to the walls at the entire perimeter.  And of course we did another round of priming and painting on those fresh edges.

The installation of the plywood subfloor was a war of attrition between us and the natural tendency of plywood to warp.  Even if you use the best (baltic birch).  Even if you seal all sides and edges to avoid asymmetric moisture uptake.  This section can be organized into what we planned to do, what we tried to do, and what we ended up doing after we started over and did it again.

### What we planned to do
Our first idea was to join the four pieces of plywood using biscuits.  This should keep the plywood edges aligned (in plane) at the seems.  However to do this would require joining the pieces outside the van and moving in as a monolith.  The pieces couldn't be fit up in place because the wheel wells and other protrusions require the floor pieces to come in from above and drop straight down, preventing the insertion of the biscuits into the mating slots.

This is do-able, and we purchased some long 16ft 2x4s to help strong back the monolith for movement into the van.  However, as we got closer to this part of the build we got nervous about this approach.  By joining the structure ahead of time, we would eliminate the ability to shift the pieces independantly.  If, for example, when we joined the pieces outside, one was slighly out of position, we could end up with contact between the subfloor and van wall and thus a squeak.  At that point we would have no real ability to fix it.

9/4/21
To keep the edges from popping and increase ease and flexibility of install, we pivoted from our original plan.

We originally planned to biscuit the four plywood sections together and install as a monolithic piece.  However, during our trial fit we discovered a few things that challenged this approach.  One, we found that some pieces of plywood were cupped, or warped such that the edges were popping up.  We didn't think the biscuits would solve this problem completely.  Two, each piece of plywood has an optimal location that ensures clearance to the van walls.  If this clearance doesn't exist, the floor will squeak as it is loaded and unloaded.  Ensuring each piece will end up in its optimal locations when joining outside the van seemed challenging, if not impossible.

So we woke up with a new plan.  Fix small wooden blocks to the floor that cross the seams of the plywood pieces.  Install the plywood and get each piece to its optimal position.  Screw the plywood to these fixed blocks.  Everything should lay quite flat at the seams, and sit right where it needs to.

We glued 1/2 strips of baltic birch together.  We used a hand planer to plane the thickness of the glued strip down to about 7/8 inch.  This locates the top of the blocks just below the top layer of foam, which is what we want.

We cut the strips into 1.5 inch by 2.5 inch blocks.

We sealed the blocks on all but the bottom with two coats of Kilz primer.

While I fabb'd the blocks, Sophia cut the bottom layer of minicell foam and cleaned off the contact cement in the areas we planned to mount the blocks.

Finally, we scuffed the factory paint in the mount locations and used J-B Weld 8276 KwikWeld to epoxy the blocks to the floor.  It advertises a strength of 3127 psi, an oddly specific number, but even a quarter of that would be more than enough.


We also took this opportunity to epoxy the step delete into place.  Like the blocks, it will also be used to anchor the plywood layer.

## Notes

Our passenger side wheel well is shifted about 3/16 aft compared to the driver side.  This led to some small interferences and re-cutting of the plywood since we made a single template based on the driver side and used it to cut both sides of the plywood.  If we had to do it over, we would have made two templates, or adjusted the template between marking the driver and passenger side.

Talk about shift and any possible improvemnts (two batches of epoxy)
