Fabricated a tool that will allow tightening the short sections (6")

2021-11-?
Finished driver side

2021-11-7
Assembled passenger side

20201-11-8
Fixed on missing 6 incher on driver - one to go
Removed extra piece and braced on passenger side
Loaded passenger side
Cut the long fore-aft pieces to length
Cut the rear-most athwart piece to length
Measured for wood.

2021-11-9
Picked up Okoume from annapolis (and pvc from homedepot)
Cut peices for the back of the structure

TODO: Remove 12V power point in back passenger side.

Notes:
Rear Cross member is 58+3 3/8 (can make 1/2 or drop to a quarter) = 61 3/8 - will round down to 61 1/4
Rear fore-aft length is cut to 70 inches (can tolerate stock on of 1/8-1/4)

13.5 + 3 3/8 lower edge of upper rail to top of wall 8020 - same at front of driver galley = 13 4/8 + 3 3/8 = 16 7/8 
20 3/8 + 3 3/8 inner edge of wheel well structure to inner edge fore-aft = 23 6/8 = 23 3/4

remove 12v power point in back pass side

2021-11-11
Soph removed 12V power point
Soph drilled and fitup the upper back pieces
Soph installed rear double angle brackets on fore-aft inner upper pieces

2021-11-12
Soph drilled and fitup the lower back pieces

Notes on Thru-bolting
Planning to use 3/8 ID 3/4 OD FR4 Tube for spacer through floor
Using 1/8 inch thick FR4 sheet for spacer above bracket
1/4 ID 3/4 OD Washer on outside
Grade 5 1/4-20 bolt 2.5 inches long zinc
1/4-20 Grade 5 lock nut zinc

Notes on Multiplus and SmartSolar Mounting
-Threaded fastners get super mixed review
-Tee Nuts on Van 1.0 were finicky but ok
-Planning to use M6 screw in tee nuts
-Ordering #7 1/2 wood screw to support

Lots of time spent doing initial layout of electrical to make sure back panels make sense.
Decided to relocate espar to front to remove duct conflict

2021-11-15
Figured out holes and pass throughs
Partial final squaring of driver side
Lots of spent thought on panel mounting (plan to route mount areas down to 1/4")
May use drop in, may use screw in with drop in nuts, may use cut drilled brackets with threaded clips

2021-11-16
Maybe a new entry on panels
Added holes to back panels for wire pass through
fab'd tiny wheel well panel for transfer switch
3 coats of water based spar urethane on back panels

21-11-18:
sanded and added another coat to panels

21-11-18:
fab'd floor spacers (per below)

Through bolting spacer thickness update:

Assuming nominal foam dimension:

Length: 0.4in + 0.5 in + 12mm (BB) + 2mm (lon marine) = 22.86mm + 12mm + 2mm = 36.860mm = 1.4511811 in = 1 7.2/16 in

Assuming expanded pvc + VHB tapee
Length: 13/16 + 0.045 + 12mm + 2mm = 20.6375mm + 1.143mm + 12mm + 2mm = 35.781mm = 1.40870079 in = 1 6.5/16 in

Spacer should be 1 3/8 to 1 7/16.  Shoot for just over 1 3/8.

21-11-20:
added a brushed edge coat to all back panels just in case
squared driver side
installed vertial piece for electrical

21-12-2
added temp support for driver side
