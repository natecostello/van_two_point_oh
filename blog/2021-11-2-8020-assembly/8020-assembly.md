TODO: Remove 12V power point in back passenger side.

Notes:
Rear Cross member is 58+3 3/8 (can make 1/2 or drop to a quarter) = 61 3/8 - will round down to 61 1/4
Rear fore-aft length is cut to 70 inches (can tolerate stock on of 1/8-1/4)

13.5 + 3 3/8 lower edge of upper rail to top of wall 8020 - same at front of driver galley = 13 4/8 + 3 3/8 = 16 7/8 
20 3/8 + 3 3/8 inner edge of wheel well structure to inner edge fore-aft = 23 6/8 = 23 3/4
