2021-11-9:
Picked up 6 sheets of 1/4 PVC
Cut wall panel pieces (not sure if we actually used these)

12-31-2021
Confirmed upper factory holes are M8-1.25 and that thread starts ~ 1/2 below surface of wall/neoprene (so add to any length).
Also confirmed that lower strip of L-track will interfere with any bolt heads using those holes.

1-3-2022
Designed and placed order for wall panel stiffener brackets.

1-4-2022
Designed and placed order for wall panel 8020 attachment brackets.

1-6-2022
Cut two wall stiffeners
Modified one wall stiffener with wood "wedges" to account for angle.

1-11-2022

Upholstered sliding door panel as a trial and installed

1-12-2022
Cut wall panel 8020 brackets

1-13-2022
Cut wall stiffener brackets
Soph installed plus nuts in wall stiffener brackets
Soph installed puls nuts in wall panel 8020 brackets

1-15-2022
Marked, drilled, primed, painted holes for stiffener bracket plus nuts
Cut 2 additional stiffener panels
Angle drilled 8020 bolting holes to ensure flush/perpendicular bolting

1-16-2022
Installed plusnuts for angle stiffener brackets
Installed stiffener brackets and locktited
Installed wall panel 8020 brackets and locktited
Temp installed wall stiffeners for templating
Ordered fasteners and threaded inserts for fan and light switch mounting

Notes:
Fan Mount plate thickness for fastener length: 0.5 inches
Wall panel thickness for fastener length: 0.5 inches
Stiffener thickness for fastener length: 0.5 inches
Fan fastener head max diameter: 0.27 inches
Therefore need 1.25-1.5 inch long fasteners ([these](https://www.mcmaster.com/98164A444/)). 
(went short to allow mounting up in stiffener bracket region)

Light switch thickness for fastener length: 1.06 inches
Wall panel thickness for fastener length: 0.5 inches
Stiffener thickness for fastener length: 0.5 inches
Therefore need 1.75 to 2 inch long fastener

1-17-2022

Picked up two more expanded PVC sheets at Home Depot

1-18-2022
Finished templating wall stiffener panels
Drilled wall panel stiffeners
Gun didn't work so couldn't urethane

Fit up wall panels and marked holes with transfer screws and random fasteners

1-19-2022
Added holes to passenger and driver side mid and aft wall panels.
Fit checked holes in passenger and driver mid and aft wall panels.
Sophia Upholstered passenger and driver side mid and aft wall panels.


1-20-2022

Write the content for a blog post.  The tone should be informal and include technical detail for someone trying to reproduce the work.

The output should be the full content of a markdown file in markdown format.

Provide the output in a code text box to allow copying the markdown.

It will include a TLDR at the beginning that summarizes the content focusing on actions.  The TLDR should start with "We..."

It should include section headers of size "##"

The second to last section will be titled "What We Would Change", which you do not need to produce content for.

The dates in the notes can be used by you to determine order, but should not be included in the post.

This post will include the following image files:

bare-panel-adding-holes.jpeg: an image of using a file to add holes to a bare panel that match holes in a stiffener panel
bare-panel-fitup-with-holes.jpeg: an image of two bare panels with holes drilled matched to the stiffener panels
bare-panel-hole-markup.jpeg: an image showing the fitup of a bare panel to a stiffener panel using neoprene material as spacers to get correct placement
complete.jpeg: an image of the completed work
holes.jpeg: an image of adding holes to a panel with soldering iterations
lower-wall-panel-bracket-locations.jpeg: a elevation view drawing that shows a panel stiffener and panel bracket locations
passenger-complete.jpeg: an image that shows the completed passenger side panels, fan, and light switch installed
slider-panel.jpeg: an image of the completed slider door panel
stiffener-bracket-holes: an image showing the holes drilled that a stiffener bracket will fasten too
stiffener-bracket-installed.jpeg: an image showing a stiffener bracket installed
stiffener-bracket-positioning.jpeg: an image showing use of a stiffener panel, and bare panel material, to correctly set the placement of a stiffener bracket
upholstered-panel-install.jpeg: an image showing the installation of the rear passenger wall panel
wall-panel-stiffener.jpeg: an image of a wall panel stiffener with the fan mount and light switch mount installed
bracket-dims.png: A flat drawing of the stiffener brackets
bracket-profile-context.png: A sketch that shows the angle and placement of the stiffener brackets

Include the markdown text to insert the photos throughout the content.  If possible locate the photos near relevant content.  Also include a caption in italics under each image.

The post should include a section titled "Jargon" near the beginning.  Under this section it should define the following terms:

Stiffener Bracket: Acutely angled brackets that bolt to underside of the upper wall voids.  They are precisely angled so the exposed face matches the plane of the outward face above the wall void.
Panel Stiffener: A piece of 1/2" plywood that attaches to the 8020 structure at it's bottom and to a stiffener bracket at it't stop.  These bridge the wall void and provide stiffness and a fastening point for the wall panels to allow mounting fans and controls.
Panel Bracket: Small, slightly angled brackets that are mounted to the backside of the upper 8020 structure.  They provide a fastening point for the upholstered wall panels.

Below is a general template for the markdown file:

**TLDR: [Insert TLDR text]**

## Section 1
[Insert some content]
## Section 2
[Insert more content]
## Section X
[Insert even more content]

## What We Would Change

END FIRST PROMPT

SECOND PROMPT

Provide the text for new section at the end titled "Timeline".  It will contain a bulleted list of sentence fragments of what was done on each day listed in the notes provided.  In the notes, dates precede the actions completed on that date.  Each bulleted fragment should end with the date of the associated actions in parenthesis.  The date format should be the three letter abbreviation of the day of the week, capitalized and followed by YYYY-MM-DD.  The output should be markdown text in a codebox.
