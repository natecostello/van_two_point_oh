Going the slider route.

These are low-profile enough to clear the door:

The length will be the 24" model.

Will need to double up 8020 to mount on bottom, maybe top.  Will mount flat overhanging bar to the face, and then tuck 1/4 wood panel behind, hole saw'ed out in an array for ventilation.

Can mount to 80/20 using https://www.tnutz.com/product/qt-015/ #8-32 tnuts and screws.  Will need to source low head #8 machine screws.  These [screws](https://www.mcmaster.com/90357A003/) could/might work.
