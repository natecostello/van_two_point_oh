## Faucet

Candidates:

KRAUS Oletto Single-Handle Pull-Down Sprayer Kitchen Faucet

[Sink Drain connection](https://www.amazon.com/Ambassador-Marine-Brushed-Finish-Strainer/dp/B00GD8RY7K/ref=pd_rhf_ee_s_bmx_0_7/132-6172178-6878621?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00GD8RY7K&pd_rd_r=c5ead015-bd52-4676-851c-ed77fa559e6c&pd_rd_w=lIYF5&pd_rd_wg=9EE78&pf_rd_p=ab01b43d-20a4-41f2-b80b-e4dd747d1a01&pf_rd_r=KWM085Z2HEQC6C1JMNZG&psc=1&refRID=KWM085Z2HEQC6C1JMNZG)

## Storage

The baseline plan is 15 gallons of storage with jerry cans.  In the future, a large tank could be fabricated to allow more water storage.

## Graywater

The sink will drain outside the van to a temporary collection botter where needed (e.g. and empty milk jug).

## Pump

24V Shurflo

## Reverse Osmosis

Eventually, given the amount of time we spend ocean side, it would be advantageous to have an RO desalinator.  DIY is doable.  The cost is the high pressure pump and drive motor, but integration looks doable.
